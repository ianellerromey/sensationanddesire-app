Jhansi Aur - Encounter VI
[???? MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ ?.??% Luminosity

Velocity led the Asterings back into the semicircle of cars, past the crowd, toward a back corner. A lime green 2003 Subaru Baja sat atop the thin grass growing at the edge of the beach, lights off, tailgate hanging open, the bed affixed with an extender. Several stacked plywood crates rested in the bed, glowing faintly from within. A decal of a trendy anime protagonist stared at Jhansi from one of the rear windows.
A red-headed special one lounged on the hood of the Subaru. They wore an oversized black t-shirt patterned with a psychedelic rendition of the characters from a popular adult cartoon, a pair of dark tie-dyed board shorts, no shoes, and a pair of aviators. A melange of anime-inspired tattoos spilled down their arms.
They grinned as Velocity approached.
“Loki!”
Velocity smiled back.
“And here I figured the pet name was temporary.”
Mister Merchant sat up.
“What’s with the entourage?”
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“You remembered my pet name, but not my lore. I’ve gotta dock some points.”
MM spread his arms.
“Lore is the past, babe. The past is dead.”
Velocity chuckled darkly.
“I fuckin’ wish.”
MM shrugged.
“If you can dream it, you can make it come true.”
Velocity nodded.
“Great. Perfect. Exactly what I wanted to hear.”
They gestured toward the bed of the Subaru.
“I dream of a flare gun. Think I can make that dream come true, Sandy?”
Moonlight glinted off the silver tooth in Sandy’s grin.
“I know you can, Loki.”
They climbed up onto the roof of the Subaru and began rummaging through the plywood crates.
Binyelum appraised the scene.
Sebastian whispered, “Is this guy for real?”
Velocity said, “I was waiting for you to say that.”
Bineylum called out, “Hey Sandy, where’d you get all that stuff?”
Sandy raised a hand over his shoulder, index finger extended.
“The first rule of merchandise, my fine fall out friend, is to never reveal your sources.”
Binyelum snorted.
“Does it have anything to do with that knocked over mobling caravan?”
Sandy froze for half a second.
“One of the doctor’s rumors?”
Binyelum smirked.
“Actually, we saw it happen.”
Sandy looked up.
“The fuck you did.”
Binyelum’s smirk widened.
“You’re so certain. Because you were there?”
Sandy blanched.
He paused, then threw both hands into the air.
“Fine, whatever. Yeah, this stuff’s from the caravan.”
Binyelum nodded.
“You saw it happen, didn’t you?”
Sandy exhaled.
“Yeah, I saw it.”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“What did it?”
Sandy’s eyebrows appeared above his aviators.
“Colorless.”
Binyelum whistled.
“What’s a colorless want with a mobling caravan?”
Binyelum’s eyes narrowed.
“Wait–”
Sandy nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Wow.”
They shook their head.
“How in the hell does that happen?”
Sandy shrugged.
“If you can dream it, man.”
Binyelum laughed.
“I guess so.”
Jhansi looked from Binyelum to Sandy, then at each of the Asterlings, all of whom wore expressions of dawning comprehension.
Something else she didn’t understand.
Fucking perfect.
Sandy adjusted the top crate, reached into the one below it, and pulled out a bright orange flare gun.
“The Sandman delivers.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That’s a terrible nickname.”
Sandy scowled.
“That’s how you want to bargain?”
Binyelum raised both hands.
“I just think you deserve something that fits the vibe. The Sandsation.”
Oren said, “Sand By Me.”
Velocity said, “Sandynamite.”
Sebastian said, “Sandeeznuts.”
Nancy shoved Sebastian playfully.
Jhansi said, “The Sand of Fate.”
Sandy stared at the Asterlings.
“You guys are idiots.”
The Asterlings burst into laughter.
Sandy shook his head.
He twirled the flare gun around his index finger, then paused.
He held the gun delicately in both hands, examining it.
“What do you guys want with this thing, anyway?”
He looked around his hands.
“You wanna let every boogeyman in the city know where you are?”
He fidgeted, pulling the gun against his chest.
“You’re not firing this here.”
He’d said it as a statement.
Binyelum shook their head.
“No, we’re not firing here.”
They gestured around.
“We wouldn’t be able to get nearly enough attention.”
Sandy frowned, then shrugged.
“Whatever. It’s your dust.”
Binyelum smiled.
“Then we’ll take it off your hands.”
Sandy waved the gun.
“Don’t get cocky. I’m not gonna let you kill yourself for free.”
Binyelum scratched their head.
“Planning to use that thing yourself?”
Sandy raised two fingers.
“The second rule of merchandise–”
Binyelum waved their hand.
“Yeah yeah.”
Sandy scowled.
Binyelum continued.
“You won't regret trading it for a memory card.”
Sandy blinked, then laughed.
“A memory card?”
He reached back at patted the bottom crate.
“What do you think I’ve got in here? I wouldn't even know what to do with all these memory cards.”
He looked out over the Asterlings.
“Maybe I could trade ‘em for a Final Hand weapon.”
Binyelum smiled.
“If you wanted one of those, you should’ve joined the Final Hand.”
Sandy shuddered.
“You are just determined to insult me.”
He sighed.
“Ah well. Maybe I already have everything I want. The wealth of a winner, the safety of the social elite.”
He gestured out at the party.
“Access to all my desires for the rest of the night.”
He pulled the gun close to his chest.
“I guess you guys should’ve rolled better.”
He paused, then grinned.
“Tell you what. Bring me something fun to play with, and I’ll teach you how to play the game.”
What?
No.
Absolutely the fuck not.
Jhansi stepped forward.
“Fuck you.”
Sandy smirked.
He opened his mouth.
Jhansi talked over him.
“How many memory cards have you pulled free with your bare hands?”
Sandy’s mouth fell into a hard line.
“Listen–”
Jhansi kept going.
“How many times have you shared your gift?”
Sandy’s mouth pulled into a snarl.
Jhansi kept going.
“Buy a Final Hand weapon?”
She laughed and shook her head.
“What a sad joke. Could you even carry one of those things?”
Sandy barked, “Shut the fuck up.”
Jhansi kept going.
“You don't have what it takes. You're nothing like them.”
Sandy jumped down from the Subaru.
“What, a bootlicking peon?”
Jhansi laughed again.
“At least they believe in something. You think you're a winner? You're just a bottom-feeding nobody. You lucked into one single iota of power tonight, and what are you doing with it?”
She glared.
“Trading it away for sexual favors from stoned party kids.”
Sandy pointed the flare gun at Jhansi.
“What the fuck do you know, huh?”
He gestured with the gun.
“Who do you think you are? You think you're out there playing the hero? You fucking dumbass. Nobody gives a shit. You're gonna die at the end of the night, same as the rest of us.”
He gestured toward the Asterlings.
“Same as your dumbass friends.”
He gestured toward the party.
“Same as those idiot kids.”
He gestured at the air.
“Same as the fucking Final Hand bozos.”
He gestured at himself.
“Same as me.”
He pointed the gun again at Jhansi.
“Only difference is, I’m actually making the best of what I’ve got. It's everyone for himself out here. Sorry not sorry, life ain't fair.”
Jhansi snorted.
She produced the bloodstained memory card.
“You see this?”
Sandy didn't reply.
Jhansi chuckled.
“You really think I’m afraid of you?”
A voice called from behind Jhansi.
“I wanna hear more about these Final Hand bozos.”
Everyone turned.
Two Final Hand soldiers stood silhouetted by the lights of the party, dark weapons restless against their shoulders.
Sandy cursed.
“Pejudo lo anmo.”
He lowered the gun and let his head fall back.
The soldier with broader shoulders took a step forward.
“You know how this ends, right?”
An expression passed briefly across Sandy's face.
The other soldier walked up to the bed of the Subaru.
“Thanks for bringing in all this loot for us. You're a real pal. The Final Hand won't forget this.”
The first soldier walked up to Sandy.
“Whacha got there?”
They grabbed the gun from Sandy and held it dangling by the grip.
“Nice.”
They dragged out the vowel sound.
“Brandishing an interference weapon and talking shit about the Final Hand at a party where they're on active patrol duty.”
They smacked Sandy's shoulder.
“You’ve got a lotta confidence, buddy.”
The other soldier stepped over.
“Doesn't look like there's any others in his band. Just him and the Baja.”
The first soldier leaned in toward Sandy, his voice dripping with mock concern.
“Oh no, you got separated from your friends?”
The other soldier nodded.
“Has to be. A guy like this would never leave a pal behind to die.”
Sandy shrugged off the first soldier’s hand.
“I get it, I get.”
He inhaled, then cursed.
“Fuck!”
He kicked the wheel of the Subaru.
The first soldier went to put their hand on Sandy's shoulder again. Sandy knocked it away. He turned to look at the Asterlings, baring his teeth at Binyelum and Jhansi. He opened his mouth, then closed it. He yanked open the door to his Subaru.
The second soldier grabbed the back of Sandy’s neck.
“Whoa there, you don't want to leave with all our gifts, do you?”
Sandy groaned.
The first soldier turned to Binyelum and nodded at the crates.
“Give me a hand with these.”
Binyelum jabbed their elbow at the other Asterlings.
“He picked me!”
The soldier said, “Ha ha.”
Binyelum and the soldier unpacked the bed of the Subaru.
Sandy stood in the grip of the other soldier, watching limply.
Oren turned to Jhansi.
“Well done.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Huh?”
Oren smirked and shook his head.
“No, of course you didn't do it on purpose. Still.”
He shrugged.
“Nice job.”
Warmth flooded Jhansi's chest.
A door slammed behind her. The sound of engine bells followed. Headlight luminescence washed over the scene, throwing long shadows. The Subaru's wheels spun hard, throwing sand.
The car backed away haphazardly, beyond the semicircle of cars, and lurched along the beach toward the city.
Everyone stood in silence until the tail lights passed out of sight.
The broader soldier said, “What a miserable little shit.”
The other said, “He’s not gonna last another hour.”
Binyelum nodded at the first soldier.
“How do you feel about parting with that?”
The soldier held up the flare gun.
“This?”
Binyelum nodded.
The soldier again examined the gun.
“An interference weapon is a big deal.”
They looked at Jhansi.
She blinked.
Should she say something?
The soldier looked back at Binyelum.
“I can't just give it to you.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Your friends up by the docks, they're dismantling a bigass alterling.”
The soldier nodded.
“I know. What about it?”
Binyelum tilted their head.
“I know something about how it works.”
The soldier straightened.
“And you think we can't figure it out?”
Binyelum raised both hands.
“Not at all. But knowing quicker might help your friends have an easier time tonight.”
The soldier stood for a moment.
They looked again at Jhansi.
They kept looking at her as they replied to Binyelum.
“Ah what the hell. I'm feeling generous.”
They gestured at Binyelum.
“Follow me back up to the captain.”
They turned to the other soldier.
The other soldier said, “Yeah, I’ll take care of the crates.”
The broader soldier nodded.
They motioned. The Asterlings followed them back through the party. They held a brief conversation with another pair of soldiers, then ducked into the 1996 Infiniti G20.
The Asterlings piled into Mambele.
Jhansi ended up in Oren’s lap. 
Sebastian gave them a look.
“Oh hey. No more pee.”
Jhansi gave him the middle finger.
Mambele pulled forward, following the Infiniti back toward the docks.
Velocity said, “We’re really fucking doing this, huh?”
Binyelum said, “The whole thing.”
Sebastian said, “We’re so fucking dead.”
Oren grinned.
“Die like a star.”
Sebastian laughed darkly.
“I’m beginning to realize I should have given that more thought.”
Velocity laughed once.
“Story of my fucking life.”
Their pendant twinkled.
The Infiniti parked at the edge of the concrete.
Binyelum pulled up alongside it.
They looked in the rearview mirror.
“You guys wait here.”
Jhansi blinked.
Some strange feeling buzzed around inside her.
She didn’t like it.
Sebastian droned, “And they were never heard from again.”
Velocity sang a bittersweet melody reminiscent of a JRPG game over screen.
Oren said, “You’re not even taking Nancy?”
Binyelum laughed brightly.
“You guys are so cute. I’m going to be fine. But thank you for your concern.”
Jhansi watched Binyelum’s back as they stood from Mambele. They greeted the soldier, and together they walked along the dock toward the larger Final Hand assembly. The giant alterling lay completely disassembled, many of its parts missing altogether, transported somewhere into the night.
What kind of weapons would the Final Hand make from that corpse?
Could they use the pylons?
The thought left Jhansi feeling uneasy.
Sebastian gestured at Velocity’s camera.
“You said the candies were free. You didn’t say how you got that.”
Sebastian narrowed his eyes.
“Did you really fuck that guy?”
Velocity laughed.
“I didn’t fuck him.”
Sebastian made a face.
“Do you deliberately scare standards away, or do you just not know how to recognize them?”
Velocity shrugged.
“The human was trash, but the character was fine.”
Sebastian snorted.
“The character sucked.”
Velocity grinned.
They leaned in closer to Sebastian.
“What’s this?”
They cocked their head.
“I know this feeling.”
They cocked their head to the other side.
“It’s jealousy.”
Sebastian punched Velocity’s shoulder.
Nancy watched the exchange with an impassive expression.
Oren said, “He was trash though.”
Velocity sighed.
“Never meet your heroes.”
Jhansi said, “What’s a candy?”
Everyone looked at her.
Velocity grinned.
“A sweet treat.”
Jhansi ignored them.
She nodded at Oren.
“You told me that they exist, but not what they do.”
Oren smiled.
“Candies give your sword a temporary boost. The effects vary pretty greatly. They’re kind of a big deal. It’s crazy that Velocity got some for free.”
Velocity stared at Sebastian as they replied.
“I could be lying.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
Jhansi said, “Can I see them?”
Velocity held out their hand.
Three brightly glowing orbs clustered together, one yellow, one blue, one pink. Tiny symbols tumbled off each, spinning through the air, dissipating like smoke. Exclamation points formed from lightning bolts drifted off the yellow candy. Exclamation points shaped into arrows drifted off the blue candy. Exclamation points ending in hearts drifted off the pink candy.
Jhansi said, “Fucking sick.”
Sebastian said, “The simple joys of a child.”
Jhansi glared at him.
She looked at Velocity.
“What do they do?”
Velocity shrugged.
“Beats me.”
Jhansi raised both eyebrows.
She looked around.
“Anybody?”
Oren said, “I’m pretty sure the yellow one adds some kind of extra impact. I’d guess the blue one adds some kind of status effect, maybe something that affects your enemy’s movement. No idea about the pink one.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Huh.”
A shadow loomed outside Mambele.
Binyelum opened the driver’s side door.
“Team meeting.”
Everyone piled out of the sedan.
Binyelum twirled the flare gun around their finger.
Jhansi beamed.
“You got it!”
Binyelum nodded.
“You doubted me?”
Jhansi blurted, “Never.”
Everyone looked at her.
Oren, Velocity, and Sebastian laughed.
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum smiled warmly.
They snapped their fingers.
“Alright. We’ve gotta take this somewhere it’ll be visible across most of the city.”
Oren said, “Sandy wasn’t wrong about the kind of attention that’ll attract.”
Binyelum nodded.
“I don’t like it either. If we make the wrong choice, there’s a solid chance it’s our last choice.”
Jhansi said, “We could go back to the Washington Center.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Don’t wanna trap us at the top of a building.”
Jhansi frowned.
It made sense.
Why couldn’t she ever stop to think?
Stupid bitch.
Binyelum continued.
“That means anything downtown is off limits. The Beanstalk, the Wells Fargo Tower, bad vibes.”
Velocity said, “Good. I didn’t wanna climb fifty stories anyway.”
Sebastian said, “There’s the Health Sciences Alliance campus up on the hill.”
Velocity smacked everyone’s shoulder.
“Yeah! If a problem shows up, we’ll get to dramatically escape down the aerial tram line!”
Oren gave Velocity a look.
“The tram’s not running.”
Velocity mimicked using their sword as a zipline trolley.
“Wheee!”
Sebastian said, “You’re an idiot.”
Oren said, “Wouldn’t they just cut the tram line?”
Binyelum said, “The campus is a good idea though.”
They looked out into the night, up toward the city.
“I want to scout the way.”
Oren followed Binyelum’s gaze.
“From all the way down here?”
Binyelum nodded.
“From the top of the Strawberri Eight.”
Sebastian frowned.
“Can we even get up there anymore? Wasn’t it obliterated?”
Binyelum nodded again.
“Parts of it for sure, but not the whole thing. And there’s no way we’re gonna run into anybody else on our way up there.”
Sebastian nodded.
“Huh.”
Binyelum turned to Jhansi.
“And you, princess, are staying behind.”
Everyone looked at Binyelum.
What?
Left behind?
Did Binyelum not trust her?
Static exploded along the perimeter of Jhansi’s interior space.
“What?”
She could do nothing to stop the petulance in her tone.
“Why?”
Oren looked between Binyelum and Jhansi.
Velocity frowned.
“For good?”
Sebastian looked confused.
He opened his mouth, then closed it again.
Nancy stared at Binyelum.
Binyelum replied to Velocity.
“Only if she wants.”
Jhansi scowled.
“Did I do something wrong?”
Binyelum nodded.
“You did.”
A thick arm of static swung hard against Jhansi’s back.
“You didn’t have fun.”
What?
Jhansi’s scowl deepened.
“That’s not my fault!”
Binyelum smiled warmly.
“Princess, you’re not actually in trouble. This isn’t a punishment.”
Jhansi stamped her foot.
“It feels like it!”
Binyelum nodded slowly.
“I’m sorry that it feels that way.”
They gestured around, at the whole of the night.
“I don’t know why, but you don’t understand how anything works.”
They looked at Jhansi.
“This might be your last chance tonight to find some perspective.”
Jhansi opened her mouth, but Binyelum kept talking.
“You are a good person.”
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum continued.
“You don’t have to work so hard to prove it.”
They looked around at the other Asterlings.
“Everyone here loves you, and appreciates all your hard work.”
Binyelum shrugged gently.
“Nobody will think any less of you if you decide you want to have fun with the rest of your night.”
Sebastian made a face.
“Hey! Why didn’t I get this option!”
Binyelum turned a hard gaze on Sebastian.
“Because that’s not the direction in which you need to be growing.”
Sebastian blinked.
Jhansi growled, “You think I’m going to grow if you leave me behind?”
Binyelum nodded.
“If you learn how to have fun? Yes. That will be incredible growth.”
Jhansi gestured around.
“I am having fun!”
Binyelum nodded again.
“I know that you feel that way.”
“But–”
“We’ll be back, Jhansi.”
Binyelum clasped both their hands together.
“Do this as a favor, for me. If you still want to come with us once we’re done scouting, we’ll be glad to have you. If not, we’ll be glad you’ve found some peace.”
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“I’m just going to sit here and wait.”
Binyelum sighed.
“Please don’t.”
They squeezed their hands together again.
“For me.”
Jhansi’s nostrils flared.
She let out a long, low growl, until she ran out of breath.
At last she said, “Fine.”
Binyelum smiled.
“Thank you, princess.”
They gestured.
“Follow me. The Final Hand has agreed to take you back down to the party.”
The Final Hand?
So she’d have to spend even more time with people she didn’t know.
Fucking great.
Jhansi groaned.
Jhansi stepped forward.
Oren gave her a long look.
“Take care of yourself.”
Velocity said, “A pampered life suits a princess.”
Sebastian said, “Maybe don’t watch more monster orgies, yeah?”
Nancy gave her an indecipherable expression.
Jhansi said, “I’ll see you guys soon.”
She added, “Don’t fucking die on me.”
Velocity jabbed Sebastian in the ribs.
“Imagine the meltdown she’d have.”
Jhansi smiled in spite of herself.
Binyelum turned, and Jhansi stepped to keep up.
The rest of the Asterlings stood watching in the pair’s lengthening shadows.
Jhansi turned to Binyelum.
“You’re an asshole.”
Binyelum smiled.
“I thought I was perfect.”
Jhansi made a face.
“I guess I was wrong.”
Binyelum grinned.
“I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
A soldier greeted them. Jhansi recognized them from before. Chibi Silhouette.
