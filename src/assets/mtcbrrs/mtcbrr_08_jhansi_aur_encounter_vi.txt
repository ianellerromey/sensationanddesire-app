Jhansi Aur - Encounter VI
[???? MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ ?.??% Luminosity

Velocity led the Asterings back into the semicircle of cars, past the crowd, toward a back corner. A lime green 2003 Subaru Baja sat atop the thin grass growing at the edge of the beach, lights off, tailgate hanging open, the bed affixed with an extender. Several stacked plywood crates rested in the bed, glowing faintly from within. A decal of a trendy anime protagonist stared at Jhansi from one of the rear windows.
A red-headed special one lounged on the hood of the Subaru. They wore an oversized black t-shirt patterned with a psychedelic rendition of the characters from a popular adult cartoon, a pair of dark tie-dyed board shorts, no shoes, and a pair of aviators. A melange of anime-inspired tattoos spilled down their arms.
They grinned as Velocity approached.
“Loki!”
Velocity smiled back.
“And here I figured the pet name was temporary.”
Mister Merchant sat up.
“What’s with the entourage?”
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“You remembered my pet name, but not my lore. I’ve gotta dock some points.”
MM spread his arms.
“Lore is the past, babe. The past is dead.”
Velocity chuckled darkly.
“I fuckin’ wish.”
MM shrugged.
“If you can dream it, you can make it come true.”
Velocity nodded.
“Great. Perfect. Exactly what I wanted to hear.”
They gestured toward the bed of the Subaru.
“I dream of a flare gun. Think I can make that dream come true, Sandy?”
Moonlight glinted off the silver tooth in Sandy’s grin.
“I know you can, Loki.”
They climbed up onto the roof of the Subaru and began rummaging through the plywood crates.
Binyelum appraised the scene.
Sebastian whispered, “Is this guy for real?”
Velocity said, “I was waiting for you to say that.”
Bineylum called out, “Hey Sandy, where’d you get all that stuff?”
Sandy raised a hand over his shoulder, index finger extended.
“The first rule of merchandise, my fine fall out friend, is to never reveal your sources.”
Binyelum snorted.
“Does it have anything to do with that knocked over mobling caravan?”
Sandy froze for half a second.
“One of the doctor’s rumors?”
Binyelum smirked.
They whispered, “Bingo.”
They called out, “Actually, we saw it happen.”
Sandy looked up.
“The fuck you did.”
Binyelum’s smirk widened.
“Why not?”
Sandy blanched.
He paused, then threw both hands into the air.
“Fine, whatever. Yeah, this stuff’s from the caravan.”
Binyelum nodded.
“You saw it happen, didn’t you?”
Sandy exhaled.
“Yeah, I saw it.”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“What did it?”
Sandy’s eyebrows appeared above his aviators.
“Colorless.”
Binyelum whistled.
“What’s a colorless want with a mobling caravan?”
Binyelum’s eyes narrowed.
“Wait–”
Sandy nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Wow.”
They shook their head.
“How in the hell does that happen?”
Sandy shrugged.
“If you can dream it, man.”
Binyelum laughed.
“I guess so.”
Jhansi looked from Binyelum to Sandy, then at each of the Asterlings, all of whom wore expressions of dawning comprehension.
Something else she didn’t understand.
Fucking perfect.
Sandy adjusted the top crate, reached into the one below it, and pulled out a bright orange flare gun.
“The Sandman delivers.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That’s a terrible nickname.”
Sandy scowled.
“You’re terrible at bargaining.”
Binyelum raised both hands.
“I just think you deserve something that fits the vibe. The Sandsation.”
Oren said, “Sand By Me.”
Velocity said, “Sandynamite.”
Sebastian said, “Sandeeznuts.”
Nancy shoved Sebastian playfully.
Jhansi said, “The Sand of Fate.”
Sandy stared at the Asterlings.
“You guys are idiots.”
The Asterlings burst into laughter.
Sandy shook his head.
He twirled the flare gun around his index finger, then paused.
He held the gun delicately in both hands, examining it.
“What do you guys want with this thing, anyway?”
He looked around his hands.
“You wanna let every boogeyman in the city know where you are?”
He fidgeted, pulling the gun against his chest.
“You’re not firing this here.”
He’d said it as a statement.
Binyelum shook their head.
“No, we’re not firing here.”
They gestured around.
“We wouldn’t be able to get nearly enough attention.”
Sandy frowned, then shrugged.
“Whatever. It’s your dust.”
Binyelum smiled.
“So it’s ours?”
Sandy waved the gun.
“Don’t get cocky. I’m not gonna let you kill yourself for free.”
Binyelum gestured at the crates.
“What could we possibly have that you don’t?”
Sandy gave Velocity a rueful look, then shook his head.
He looked out over the Asterlings.
“I don’t have a Final Hand weapon.”
Binyelum smiled.
“If you wanted one of those, you should’ve joined the Final Hand.”
Sandy shuddered.
