Jhansi Aur - Encounter IV
[???? MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ ?.??% Luminosity

A thundering two-story monstrosity bore down on the food court, its massive body indiscriminately smashing apart kiosks and crossways.
Clouds of debris and shrapnel swelled in its wake.
Oh.
Fuck.
The alterling stood atop eight long legs, easily cresting the third floor of the food court. The monster had no other limbs. Its horseshoe-shaped body had the structure and topography of a rocky island, covered in soft moss. A thin membrane of brilliant blue water hovered suspended in the middle of the horseshoe. It sloshed with each heavy footfall, the shape of it curving and distending, but never spilling. Large jellyfish bounced and swayed in the water, their trailing tentacles dancing with the alterling’s gait. Intermittent bursts of energy arced between several large metallic pylons that jutted at odd angles from the monster’s body. Something like a spiraling airlock glared from the center of the body’s curve. Inert pistons protruded upward and downward from the space behind the airlock.
What the fuck.
Binyelum said, “Nope.”
They turned to the Asterlings.
Everyone took off running.
Nancy yanked Jhansi to her feet and pelted away in almost the same breath.
Dr. Chef and Sir Whack-a-knight followed.
Jhansi clutched her canvas bag against her chest and ran with all her might.
Holy fuck.
What the fuck?!
Corpses lined her vision.
One loomed directly in front of her.
A supine blue endling with its chest cavity completely annihilated.
Jhansi stumbled in.
Her foot smashed through gore and crunched against the monster’s spine.
Jhansi stumbled out.
Binyelum called, “Fuck! The goo!”
They pulled to the left.
Everyone ran to follow.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Everyone could run so much faster than her!
Even Sebastian!
The alterling closed in on the food court.
Jhansi passed out from beneath the glass shelves.
The alterling smashed into the food court.
The glass held.
But.
The supports didn’t.
Fuck.
Concrete buckled.
Fuck!
The shelves collapsed.
Oh fuck!
Each blasted against the other.
Shit!
The corpses within liquified.
Fuck!
A roiling rush of air shoved Jhansi forward.
Oh fuck!
The sound hurt.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s ears popped.
Shit!
The anchors for the first floor glass shelf groaned.
Oh fuck no.
The alterling clambered up and over the wreckage.
Fuck!
The hanging spiral sculptures shattered.
Oh fuck.
The debris smashed down and tumbled rolling off the stacked shelves.
Fuck!
Run!
Motherfucker!
Jhansi’s heart felt close to bursting.
Fuck!
Something in the structure of the building snapped.
No.
The alterling pounded forward.
The first floor glass shelf separated from the building.
All three shelves slipped from view.
Holy motherfucking shit.
Binyelum laughed.
Of course they did.
The glass hit the river.
A moaning detonation rolled across the water.
The sound shook Jhansi’s bowels.
The water warped, heaved, and erupted upward.
Tendrils of it reached into the hollow of the mall.
They glittered in the nebulite.
A final piece of the largest hanging sculpture lost all integrity and disintegrated into the darkness.
What the fuck?!
Jhansi shouted, “What the fuck?!”
Binyelum yelled, “Fucking run!”
The alterling lurched and bucked.
The water membrane stretched and distended.
Jellyfish tentacles grasped toward Jhansi.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s legs practically combusted.
Oren looked back at her, briefly.
She pleaded with her eyes.
Fuck!
She couldn’t get any help!
Fuck!
They all ran.
Jhansi did her best to keep up.
Kiosks and crossways loomed from the cloak.
Kiosks and crossways exploded behind them.
Don’t picture it.
Don’t picture it.
Don’t picture it.
Just run.
Follow everyone’s feet.
Push.
Push.
Push.
And.
See?
There it is.
That bigass spiraling stairway near the entrance.
Right there.
Don’t look back.
And don’t picture it.
Nancy pulled ahead of Binyelum.
She smashed through the doorway to the vestibule.
She smashed through the doorway to the outside.
Binyelum.
Oren.
Velocity.
Sebastian.
Dr. Chef.
Sir Whack-a-knight.
Jhansi.
Fuck!
The cold air whipped against her face.
Dr. Chef and Sir Whack-a-knight turned away from the Asterlings.
Their silhouettes disappeared into the eastern parking garage.
What?
Stupid.
The facade of the mall exploded behind Jhansi.
Dark stone, marble, and massive manufactured letters smashed down onto the cement.
A soft shadow widened on the ground in front of Jhansi.
The letter G smashed down and bounced.
Jhansi wet herself again.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Another two steps.
That thing would have crushed Jhansi’s body apart.
She felt her top half writhing as she gasped pointlessly for salvation.
She felt the obliterating terror of perceiving the gore and recognizing it as her own.
She couldn’t feel her legs lying limp on the other side of the monolithic letter.
Fuck.
A ringing whine swept the parking lot.
What the fuck?
Jhansi looked back.
The alterling turned toward the parking garage.
It smashed its body into the cement structure.
Shattering debris rained.
The monster bucked its head.
The water membrane sloshed across the bottom two levels of the structure.
A shrill scream cut through.
Fuck!
The alterling dismounted from the parking garage.
Sir Whack-a-knight writhed in the grip of a jellyfish.
They screamed again.
Double fuck.
Sir Whack-a-knight pulled against the tentacles gripping their limbs.
The tentacles pulled back.
Sir Whack-a-knight’s body went taut, all four limbs stretched wide, body splayed open and defenseless.
Oh shit.
Fuck.
The dark shape said, {“Which one are you?”}
Jhansi said, {“Oh fuck off!”}
Another tentacle wrapped around Sir Whack-a-knight’s neck.
Then squeezed.
Sir Whack-a-knight screamed louder.
Jhansi ached.
Sir Whack-a-knight bucked their hips.
Their desperate flailing availed nothing.
The tentacle squeezed harder.
Fuck!
Wait!
Hang on!
Fuck!
Sir Whack-a-knight’s screaming pitched up an octave.
Their neck burst in a splatter of red blood.
A killchime sounded.
No!
Sir Whack-a-knight's body went limp.
No!
They stopped screaming.
Fuck, no!
A piercing headiness jolted Jhansi’s entire body.
What?!
What the fuck does that feeling mean?!
Fuck!
The dark shape laughed.
The jellyfish held the corpse loosely by one wrist.
The dark silhouette dangled and swayed as the jellyfish drifted toward the airlock in the center of the alterling’s body
The airlock snapped open.
The jellyfish stuffed Sir Whack-a-knight’s corpse into the orifice.
The body's arms and legs bent at awkward angles against the opening.
The jellyfish snapped the uncooperative pieces until everything fit.
Red blood smeared all its tentacles.
The airlock snapped closed.
The pistons above and below the alterling's body began to churn.
Holy fuck.
Holy fuck.
Holy what they fuck?!
The dark shape laughed again.
Another high-pitched whine rang out.
The alterling turned.
Toward the Asterlings.
It began to gallop across the parking lot.
Oh.
Fuck.
Snot filled Jhansi’s nose.
Had she started crying?
What?!
No!
Stupid!
Shut the fuck up with that right the fuck now!
Shut the fuck up with that!
Right!
Now!
Static detonated around the perimeter of Jhansi’s interior space.
Fuck!
Not now!
Fuck!
Jhansi looked back.
She couldn’t stop herself.
The alterling flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors.
The airlock snapped open.
A new jellyfish drifted out into the bucking curves of the water membrane.
What?!
The?!
Fuck?!
Velocity called, “The Island of Dr. Oh No.”
Sebastian shouted, “What the fuck?!”
Jhansi choked on a laugh that stumbled into a sob.
Fuck.
Bastard.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s canvas bag banged against her back.
Fuck!
She swung her arms harder.
The edge of the parking lot loomed.
Binyelum pulled ahead of Nancy and disappeared over the lip of the drainage ditch.
Keep going.
So close.
So close!
The Asterlings spilled down the incline.
Velocity skidded into Mambele.
Fuck.
Mambele!
Binyelum threw wide the driver’s side door.
The Asterlings spilled into the sedan.
Jhansi stumbled over herself.
And across the threshold.
Like crossing into a sanctuary.
Her cheek bashed against Sebastian's barbell.
Shit!
Binyelum closed the driver's side door and reached for the shifter.
A grid of nine metallic rods extruded from the center console, each glowing a slightly different shade of purple, each fixed with a small handle at the tip.
Bineylum pulled the clutch trigger, slammed the top six rods fully into their housing, and stepped on the accelerator.
Mambele roared into reverse. Her tires chewed through the mud. Everyone tilted forward. The sedan mounted the incline and bounced onto the road.
Binyelum spun the steering wheel.
Mambele whipped around.
Each of her windows captured in snapshot the growing silhouette of the IDON.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s forehead banged against Sebastian's barbell.
Shit!
Bineylum pulled the clutch trigger, reconfigured the rods, and sent Mambele screeching forward.
Jhansi tried to stifle a sob.
Fuck!
Shut the fuck up!
The static had nearly dissipated.
It burst alive.
Binyelum checked the driver's side mirror.
The IDON closed in on the edge of the parking lot.
Binyelum laughed.
“Holy shit!”
They glanced over their shoulder.
“Pejudo lo anmo!”
Jhansi realized she sat in Sebastian’s lap.
What?
Fuck!
He didn't seem to have noticed.
He stared out the rearview window.
Everyone but Binyelum did.
Fair.
The IDON smashed onto the asphalt and began to pick up speed.
Oh.
No.
Shit.
Velocity said, “Sonofabitch.”
The intermittent trees lining the roadway exploded beneath the IDON’s churning legs.
Velocity said, “We’re gonna fucking die.”
Fuck.
Jhansi’s chest tightened.
Oren said, “Bineylum.”
He paused, then shook his head and gestured.
“What the fuck?”
Binyelum laughed again.
“I have no fucking idea.”
They looked in the rearview mirror.
The IDON ran with its head held low. It heaved the bulk of its body back and forth, violently sloshing the water membrane across the roadway. Jellyfish tentacles dragged against the asphalt.
Holy fucking shit.
Velocity said, “Like a jelly beard.”
What?!
Jhansi blinked at them.
Sebastian despaired, “It’s so fucking fast.”
Binyelum glanced around at everyone.
“Hey.”
They snapped for everyone’s attention.
“Don’t panic.”
They nodded.
“Think with me.”
They held up one finger.
“We can’t outrun it.”
They held up a second finger.
“We can’t fight it head on.”
They held open their palm.
“What can we do?”
Fuck.
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh.
Jhansi said, “What about your gift?”
Bineylum shook their head.
“Not a chance. No fucking telling what other bullshit that thing can do.”
They snorted.
“I don’t wanna give our new friend the chance to show off their hidden talents–”
They gestured at their chest.
“–and steal the show.”
Ugh.
Another laugh that turned into a sob.
Fuck!
Long spears of static pierced through Jhansi from every direction.
Sebastian looked at Jhansi.
Double fuck!
His unfocused eyes stared through her at something a thousand miles away.
Fair.
Oren said, “We’re smaller than it.”
He gestured.
“We can fit places that it can’t.”
Binyelum snapped again.
“That’s good.”
They held up a finger.
“But where? It’s got sonar to find us, and that water membrane can fill some pretty deep crevices.”
Velocity giggled.
“Me too.”
What?!
Binyelum raised their eyebrows.
Double what?!
Jhansi looked over her shoulder.
The IDON kept accelerating.
Fuck!
Its churning legs punctured the asphalt, each impact showering the road with debris, as the alterling pulled itself further out from the cloak.
Shit!
Velocity said, “It didn’t climb the parking structure. It just smashed into it.”
They paused.
“If we can get up high enough …”
They paused again.
“Maybe in a building?”
They paused once more.
“A building it can’t just fucking knock over.”
They paused yet again.
“Like a downtown office tower.”
They let the thought speak for itself.
Binyelum nodded slowly.
“That’s good, but not ideal. I don’t think we’d be able to get high enough, fast enough. We need to be able to drive Mambele straight into safety.”
They paused.
“And I’m not convinced that every office tower is safe from that thing.”
They fell silent.
Nobody had any other ideas.
Jhansi looked around.
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
Fuck!
Think, Jhansi.
Fucking think.
Or the Asterlings die.
Fix it.
Fix.
It.
Jhansi knew the city so well.
Landmarks and granular details alike.
Where could they go?
Where the fuck could they go?
Come on!
Come the fuck on?!
Ultrarare otherling.
Jhansi couldn’t do it.
She couldn’t fucking picture the city she knew during the day.
At all.
Fuck.
Why?
Fuck!
It looked the exact same as this place!
Didn’t it?
What did she remember about the netherlume shift?
Jhansi conjured the wide rectangle of the 7-11 parking lot. She traced in her mind the drive to The Rescue, and then to the Washington Center. She thought about the view from the tower. The cloak had annihilated everything familiar. She remembered imagining the ambient shape of the highways after Sebastian’s comment, but that didn’t help. Then back down. Back into Mambele. Dr. Satelleyez mentioned the bridge during their drive to–
The bridge.
Jhansi shouted, “The bridge!”
Binyelum perked up.
“What?”
Jhansi leaned forward.
“The bridge is up!”
She pointed at the radio.
“Dr. Satelleyez said.”
Binyelum blinked.
They glanced at her.
“Holy fuck.”
They squeezed the steering wheel.
“Good girl.”
Fuck!
What?!
Jhansi blushed.
Velocity said, “And that helps?”
They gestured.
“How? Drowning is an easier death?”
Jhansi snorted.
“I honestly have no fucking idea.”
Binyelum nodded.
“This will work.”
They looked toward Nancy.
“Killer, you’re gonna get hurt.”
Nancy blinked impassively.
She gave Binyelum a thumb’s up.
Binyelum added, “Twice.”
Nancy raised her other thumb.
Binyelum smiled, then broke into a soft laugh.
They said, “Thanks.”
Nancy blinked impassively.
Binyelum looked in the rearview mirror.
“Sebastian.”
Sebastian stared opaquely out the rearview window.
He said nothing.
Binyelum repeated, “Sebastian!”
Sebastian started. He turned around. It took a moment for his eyes to focus on Binyelum.
He shook his head.
“Shit, yeah.”
He shook his head harder.
“Sorry. What?”
Binyelum’s eyes hardened.
“We need you here, Sebastian.”
Sebastian nodded.
“Yeah, I know. Sorry. I’m here.”
Binyelum shook their head.
They spoke gently.
“We need you all the way here. Halfway isn’t enough. We need you here.”
They gestured around the cabin.
“All of us. Can you be here for all of us?”
Sebastian blinked.
He looked around, to each of the Asterlings in turn.
At last his eyes landed on Jhansi.
He blinked again, as though finally realizing that she had ended up in his lap.
He looked back at Binyelum.
“Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I’m here.”
He nodded.
“I’m here. What do you need?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Good. I knew we could count on you.”
They paused.
“We’re going to get away from that thing, but Nancy’s going to get hurt in the process. Not gently. She’s going to need you to share your gift the moment we’re safe. Do you understand?”
Sebastian blinked.
He looked at Nancy.
She stared back at him.
Sebastian said, “The moment?”
Binyelum nodded again.
“You’ll know it.”
Sebastian and Nancy continued to stare at each other.
Sebastian said, “Okay.”
He turned to Binyelum.
“Yeah. I can do that.”
Binyelum reached back to slap Sebastian’s knee.
“Yeah you fucking can.”
They glanced at Jhansi in the rearview mirror.
“Okay, Jhansi.”
Fuck.
Jhansi nodded.
“Yes!”
Binyelum chuckled.
“I’m not back up to my baseline, and I’m gonna need both shares for this. Now’s your chance to shine.”
They grinned.
Sharp canines flashed.
“Feed me.”
What?!
Jhansi blinked.
Heat rose in her cheeks.
Just like that?!
Jhansi stared at the expectant mouth.
Bineyelum stuck out their tongue.
Fuck!
Binyelum laughed.
“C’mon.”
Fuck!
What?!
With everyone watching?!
Fuck!
Jhansi pulled away.
Binyelum snapped their fingers.
“Nope.”
Fuck!
Jhansi refocused on Binyelum.
“Fuck.”
She blinked again.
“Sorry.”
She paused.
“What?”
Binyelum glared.
“I need a memory card.”
Right.
Fuck.
Right!
Jhansi opened her canvas bag.
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh no.
Jhansi blinked.
“Uh.”
Fuck.
The smashed remains of the two memory cards jangled against each other at the bottom of the bag.
Fuck!
Of course that would happen!
Fuck!
Well.
Maybe it would still work?
It had to, right?
Jhansi grabbed a larger shard from inside the bag and placed it in Bineylum’s palm.
Binyelum’s fingers closed.
They felt along the irregular edges of the shard.
They paused.
Fuck.
Binyelum said, “Jhansi, what is this?”
Fuck.
Static threatened.
Jhansi said, “It’s a piece of a memory card.”
She added an upward lilt to the end of the sentence and immediately cringed at the obvious desperation.
Binyelum exhaled.
“Jhansi, why am I holding a piece of a memory card?”
Fuck.
Jhansi waved her hands.
“I don’t know!”
She waved some more.
“My bag just got all fucked up! Sir Whack-a-knight’s hammer–”
Velocity whooped.
“Sir Whack-a-knight! I love it! I called them the Nutcracker.”
What?
Jhansi blinked at Velocity.
She finished her thought.
“–almost smashed into my face, but it ricocheted off my fire extinguisher.”
She pleaded with her eyes at Binyelum.
“Maybe they broke then?”
Binyelum exhaled slowly.
Sebastian shouted, “See? I fucking told you!”
Holy fuck!
What?!
Jhansi whipped around.
Sebastian looked around at everyone.
“She’s fucking trying to sabotage us!”
What?!
The?!
Fuck?!
Right now?!
Static exploded through Jhansi’s interior space.
Velocity said, “You fucking dumbass.”
They slapped the back of Sebastian’s head.
“The hell kind of sabotage is this? She’s gonna die too.”
Holy shit.
A whole defense.
Jhansi blinked at Velocity.
Binyelum said, “Quiet.”
Sebastian opened his mouth.
Velocity glared.
Sebastian closed his mouth.
Velocity said, “Thanks for coming to the party.”
Sebastian made a face.
Binyelum poked Jhansi with the shard.
“This isn’t how it works. I need to consume the whole thing.”
Fuck.
Pulverized streetlights smashed against the road behind them.
Fuck!
Jhansi examined the mess in her canvas bag.
Memory card shards of all sizes glittered in a heap.
Jhansi jostled the bag.
The fragments separated, but Jhansi’s brain only homogenized the shapes.
She had no fucking idea which pieces might fit together.
Fucking!
Fuck!
Static pulsed through Jhansi’s interior space.
Her hands shook.
“Uh.”
She looked at Binyelum.
“What if I give you enough pieces so that–”
Binyelum interrupted, speaking slowly.
“The whole thing, Jhansi.”
They traced a circle in midair.
“Whole. Complete. You can’t mix and match.”
Fuck!
Shit!
Jhansi peered again into her canvas bag.
Fucking trash.
A pillar of static fell crushing upon her.
Her breath came in short puffs.
“Wait!”
She looked at Binyelum.
“Just take it all!”
Binyelum paused.
They sighed.
Then grumbled.
“No.”
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“But–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“I get giftsick.”
They sighed.
“Easily.”
They paused.
“Very easily.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum?
She had no idea what to say.
Velocity and Sebastian both looked at Binyelum, eyebrows raised almost identically. Oren looked between Velocity and Sebastian, his mouth flat and eyes searching. Nancy leaned against the door, her gaze flicking casually across everyone.
Jhansi said, “I’m sorry?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“You’re always sorry.”
Hey!
Binyelum looked Jhansi straight in the eyes.
Oh fuck.
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum said, “No second guesses, and no regrets. Just focus. We all need you to focus.”
Jhansi swallowed.
She nodded.
Biyelum said, “We all need you to put together an entire memory card by the time we reach the bridge.”
Jhansi nodded again.
Binyelum said, “If you don’t, we’re going to die.”
Fuck.
Jhansi stared at the white hot light burning behind Binyelum’s gaze.
She nodded a final time.
Binyelum said, “Good girl.”
Fuck!
Jhansi blushed.
She grabbed the shard from Binyelum’s palm and turned all her attention to her canvas bag.
It filled her world.
Okay.
Fuck.
Static thundered through Jhansi’s interior space.
She had done this.
She had made this mess.
She had to fix this.
Jhansi took the shard from Binyelum.
She plunged a shaking hand into the canvas bag and seized the first shard she touched.
She held both shards against each other.
They looked like nothing more than abstract shapes.
Fuck!
Shit!
Fuck!
How in the goddamned hell could she possibly reassemble an entire fucking memory card?
Binyelum said, “How far are we from the bridge?”
Jhansi looked up compulsively.
She searched outside the windows for any identifiable landmarks.
Barely visible suggestions of buildings rushed past beyond the reach of Mambele’s headlights.
Bineylum said, “Not you, princess. No distractions.”
Shit.
Jhansi blinked.
She returned to her task.
Both shards winked at her.
Distracting.
Velocity said, “I think we just passed 77th?”
Should Jhansi put one of the shards back before digging out another?
That didn’t make sense.
Binyelum said, “Traffic sign said 71st.”
Should Jhansi sort all the pieces based on size?
That kind of thing helped with jigsaw puzzles, right?
Sebastian said, “I saw 17th, but we’re definitely not that close to the bay.”
Ugh.
Fuck.
Jhansi!
Just make a choice!
Jhansi reached into the canvas bag.
Oren shouted, “Duet!”
He leaned forward and pointed through the windshield.
Jhansi looked up.
Something like an armored truck loomed from the cloak in front of them. The tall, featureless bed and angled front end glowed with diffuse chrome radiance. The wide windshield reflected Mambele’s beaming headlights.
What the fuck?
Binyelum yelled, “Shit!”
They floored the accelerator, pulled the handbrake, and spun the steering wheel hard to the left. Jhansi’s body lurched forward.
Mambele’s rear lifted.
The sedan screeched through a tight hemisphere in the middle of the road.
Fuck.
The canvas bag shifted in Jhansi’s lap.
Fuck!
The weight of the fire extinguisher held it down.
Holy fuck.
Fuck.
Mambele slowed.
Binyelum released the handbrake, shifted the car back into a lower gear, and stepped on the accelerator.
Mambele’s tires bit at the asphalt.
Binyelum manipulated the grid of rods.
Mambele navigated upward through the gears.
The sedan accelerated back the way they’d come.
Straight toward the charging alterling.
What?!
Fuck!
Sebastian shouted, “Binyelum what the fuck!”
Velocity shouted, “We’re gonna fucking die!”
Oren shouted, “Duet!”
Mambele and the IDON converged on a narrow intersection.
Binyelum grinned.
Their knuckles went white on the steering wheel.
They leaned forward, lifted their ass off the seat, and put their entire weight on the accelerator.
The line of their teeth glittered across the dashboard.
Fuck.
Binyelum growled, “We’re gonna make it.”
They kept one foot on the accelerator but shifted their weight onto the brake, and spun the steering wheel hard to the left, this time ignoring the handbrake.
Shit.
Jhansi lurched again.
She clung to her canvas bag.
Mambele’s tires wailed.
The IDON towered.
It dug all eight legs into the asphalt, reared back, and pistoned its body forward.
Traffic lights splintered and pinwheeled through the air.
The water membrane surged in a roiling wave.
It washed over Mambele.
Jellyfish tentacles pounded at the glass. The windshield shattered. Each of the side windows followed. Grasping appendages plunged into the cabin. A rubbery vice seized Binyelum's head and squeezed it into pulp before they could make a sound.
Jhansi's heart pounded.
What?
Fuck!
Goddammit!
That didn't happen!
Bineylum shifted all their weight back onto the accelerator.
Mambele’s bells thrummed.
Her tires practically came alive.
The sedan swerved through the intersection.
The IDON’s water membrane sloshed against the passenger’s side door and the trunk.
Jellyfish tentacles slapped against metal and glass.
Mambele pulled away.
The IDON crashed backward with the force of its thwarted momentum.
Fuck!
That strange armored truck skidded straight into the IDON’s water membrane.
Double fuck!
Binyelum screamed, “Fuck!”
They laughed.
They pounded the steering wheel.
“Yes!”
They shifted into a higher gear.
Jhansi stared out the rear windshield.
The IDON stumbled over itself.
The forward points of its horseshoe body smashed into the roadway.
Gouged out chunks of asphalt swelled into uneven piles.
The alterling pushed itself back up.
It turned toward Mambele.
Its water membrane sloshed awkwardly.
Jellyfish pounded at the armored truck. The rear doors gave way. Blue endlings scrambled from the exposed bed. They skittered in their panic and confusion. A vanguard jellyfish seized an endling around the neck and lifted it into the air. Another endling grabbed both dangling legs and pulled.
Wow.
Really?
The IDON resumed its pursuit.
It began to pick up speed.
Fuck.
Jhansi squeezed Binyelum's headrest.
“What the fuck was that truck?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Endling transport.”
Fucking figured.
Jhansi said, “Why the fuck is that thing still chasing us then? There had to be a dozen endlings in that transport.”
Binyelum smiled.
“We taste better.”
Ugh.
That also fucking figured.
A sprawling intersection opened up at the end of the block. The St. Alëmskaan’machi Rail System, StARS, bisected the wide avenue. An orange nebuilte illuminated the concrete bunker stop that framed the rails. Radiance washed through the jostling cabin. Binyelum pulled left on the steering wheel, delicately preserved the sedan's acceleration, then leaned hard on the accelerator. Engine bells resonated. Mambele sped toward downtown and the bay on the wrong side of the road.
Binyelum said, “Head down, princess. Focus.”
Fuck.
Shit.
Right.
Jhansi returned to her task.
The corner of the building northeast of the intersection exploded.
Jhansi turned.
The forward points of the IDON’s horseshoe body tore through the structure.
A brick battered Mambele’s trunk.
A sonar whine echoed down the roadway.
The IDON lurched straight toward Mambele.
It smashed through the stop.
Concrete and glass exploded.
Fuck.
Binyelum said, “Which StARS station was that?”
Jhansi said, “I think that was actually 77th?”
Twenty-two blocks to the bridge.
Binyelum shook their head.
“Head down, princess.”
Shit.
Fuck.
Jhansi returned to her task.
She pulled another shard from her canvas bag.
And another.
And another.
Shrapnel filled her shaking hands.
She squeezed the pieces reflexively.
Their sharp edges dug into her skin.
She still had no fucking idea what to do about them.
But.
Jhansi had to figure this out.
She had to.
No one could save her.
If she didn’t do this, for real, all her friends would die.
She would die.
A pathetic failure beyond redemption.
Static lanced through Jhansi from every direction.
Her throat tightened.
Water welled in her eyes.
Fuck!
No!
Not now!
Not!
Now!
Jhansi’s vision doubled.
How much time did she have?
She needed some kind of framework.
Anything.
Jhansi turned.
The IDON loomed.
It looked so …
Eerie.
All that calamity, and the thing itself didn’t make any noise.
Silent pursuer.
A hard exterior shell protected the alterling’s legs. The armor distended and contracted rhythmically to accept and support all that incredible weight. Each leg tightened, swelled, and pistoned the monster forward in a deliberate and blistering choreography.
The corpse of the captured endling dangled in the grip of a jellyfish. The predator squeezed and twisted. The head separated from the body. Orange blood and stuff bubbled from the gore to splatter on the ground. The jellyfish pulled and pulled. More limbs separated.
The airlock snapped open and the jellyfish fed the dismembered corpse inside.
The airlock snapped shut.
Orange blood smeared the orifice.
The dark shape said, {“You gonna join or what?”}
Blood pounded in Jhansi’s ears.
Mambele rushed past the StARS stop on 66th.
Eleven blocks to the bridge.
Oren shouted, “Duet!”
Binyelum interrupted.
“Don’t despair.”
The stop exploded behind them.
Only ten blocks to the bridge.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!
Sebastian shouted, “Jhansi’s not ready!”
Goddamned motherfuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
Velocity shouted, “We’re gonna fucking die!”
They probably meant to make it sound like a joke.
Jhansi shook her head again.
Binyelum said, “Jhansi’s got it.”
Fucking did she though?
Jhansi shook her head yet again.
Everyone shifted.
Jhansi looked up.
Nancy leaned forward.
She looked Jhansi straight in the eyes.
And nodded.
With a perfectly impassive expression.
Jhansi blinked.
She nodded back.
She glanced around.
Everyone looked from Nancy to Jhansi.
What did the nod mean?
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Fucking fuck it!
They believed in her, but she just couldn’t do it.
She couldn’t do it!
How could she possibly fucking do this?
With everyone watching?
Dumbass retard loser.
Jhansi couldn’t let them see her like that.
She squeezed her eyes shut.
Writhing tentacles shattered Mambele’s windows.
Fuck!
Fuck!
No!
Jhansi shook her head.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Something had to change.
Something had to change.
Something had to change.
The ultrarare specialing could not let her friends die.
No fucking way.
No.
No way.
That won’t happen.
I won’t let it.
Jhansi’s world narrowed to a pinpoint.
The diamond shards in her possession glittered hungry.
Jhansi could see all of them.
They hung suspended in an organized matrix.
Jhansi could see nothing else.
Two of the shards in her grasp belonged together.
The largest piece comprised the bottom right portion of a memory card.
The smaller piece comprised the top left.
Narrow empty space separated the two pieces.
A smaller piece would fit into place as the top right corner.
And.
Two small triangular pieces and a longer quadrilateral piece would fill the void and form the rest of the memory card.
Jhansi could see all the shards she needed.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
What?!
She could do it.
She had no room for error.
But.
She could do it.
Time widened.
She planned each glacial movement.
Perfectly.
She dropped the extraneous pieces from her hand.
And.
With the other reached into the canvas bag.
Sebastian shouted, “Jhansi!”
Fuck!
Binyelum shouted, “Sebastian!”
Fuck!
Jhansi pushed forward.
She delicately grabbed one shard between her index and middle fingers and flipped it down into her palm, where she held it with her thumb.
Sebastian shouted, “It’s right behind us!”
Fuck!
Binyelum shouted, “Do you believe in your friends?”
What?!
Jhansi adjusted her hand.
She repeated the motion from before and grabbed another shard.
Sebastian shouted, “Are you fucking insane?!”
Fuck!
Binyelum just laughed.
For fuck’s sake!
Jhansi felt her weight shifting.
Oh shit!
Sebastian grabbed onto her waist.
What?!
Mambele drifted around the corner onto 55th.
Motherfucker!
The shards jostled at the bottom of the bag.
Jhansi’s gaze didn’t falter.
It couldn’t.
The roof of the bodega on the corner exploded.
Shrapnel battered Mambele.
The IDON pursued.
Engine bells resonated.
Heading toward the bridge.
No time left.
Jhansi grabbed the final shard and flipped it into her palm.
She looked up.
“Binyelum!”
Binyelum reached back without a word.
Jhansi handed over the five shards of the memory card.
Binyelum stuffed the shards into their mouth.
Their jaw pistoned.
Crunch.
Chunch.
But they didn’t swallow.
Twin steel towers rose on either side of the roadway.
The Ironsight Crossing Bridge.
Golden nebulite luminescence threw wild shadows up both structures.
Binyelum lowered both windows.
The bridge’s elevated span loomed monolithic in space.
The dark expanse of the river stretched beneath it.
A glowing beacon rushed forward.
The crossing gate.
The IDON closed in.
Jhansi felt someone grab her hand.
She squeezed as hard as she could.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Holy motherfuck.
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
Binyelum lifted themselves out of their seat.
They slammed their foot down on the accelerator, pulled the handbrake, and turned the steering wheel hard to the left.
Mambele’s tires howled in delight.
The crossing gate filled Jhansi’s vision.
Mambele’s weight shifted.
The driver’s side wheels left the asphalt.
The river swelled.
Nancy leaned out the window.
Binyelum grabbed the back of her neck.
Their fox ear headband pulsed and dimmed.
Nancy’s right arm exploded.
The golden fox head erupted forth.
Red blood sprayed across Mambele’s exterior.
The fox grinned.
And licked its lips.
And smashed its face into the roadway.
Its features deformed like putty.
It stiffened.
Then violently elongated.
The force pushed Nancy out of her seat and smashed her up against the ceiling of the cabin.
Her mouth cracked wide with pain.
Red blood burst forth.
Mambele lifted free of the roadway.
The sedan tilted as it soared through the air.
Jhansi’s breath caught in her throat.
She squeezed hard on whoever’s hand she held.
Memory card shards spilled from the canvas bag.
They shimmered in midair.
The body of the IDON passed beneath them.
Close enough to touch outside the window.
Binyelum’s bright eyes filled the rearview mirror.
Breathtaking and maniacal.
Jhansi felt hot.
All over.
She screamed.
“Binyelum!”
Electricity shook her world.
Mambele cleared the alterling’s body and careened down toward the roadway.
Binyelum swallowed the memory card they held in their mouth.
Their fox ear headband blinked back to vibrancy.
They pulled Nancy across their lap.
She reached her left arm out the driver’s side window.
Binyelum’s fox ear headband pulsed and dimmed.
Nancy’s remaining arm exploded.
Another golden fox erupted forth.
The creature smiled, then embraced the roadway. The impact pushed Nancy again against the ceiling. The golden fox deformed. Its dispersing inertia softened Mambele’s landing.
The sedan’s tires touched asphalt.
Binyelum crushed the accelerator.
Mambele blurred forward.
Sebastian reached forward, grabbed the back of Nancy’s neck, and shared his gift with her.
Petals burst from Nancy’s shattered arms.
The IDON jettisoned its water membrane out into the river.
What?!
The opposing momentum kept the alterling from falling over the edge.
The monster shoved its frontmost legs against the frame of the bridge.
And pushed.
It whirled.
Crashed to the ground.
And resumed its pursuit.
Fuck!
What the fuck?!
Holy fuck!
Jhansi grabbed the back of Binyelum’s seat with both hands.
“Oh my fucking God!”
She screamed.
“Binyelum!”
She beamed.
“That was fucking amazing!”
Sebastian kept his hand on the back of Nancy’s neck.
Nancy turned to look at him.
Velocity slapped Sebastian’s arm.
Then continued slapping everything within reach.
“Son of a fucking bitch!”
They slapped Jhansi especially hard.
“You son of a fucking bitch!”
Their swirling makeup pulled Jhansi inward.
“You fucking did it!”
Wait.
What?
Oh!
Fuck!
Right!
Fuck!
A grin exploded across Jhansi’s face.
Oren stared through the rear windshield.
“It’s still–”
He growled.
“–after us.”
Binyelum’s bright laugh cut through.
“Pejudo lo anmo, what a night!”
Binyelum drifted Mambele around the next corner, back onto the avenue that ran parallel to the river, back toward downtown and the bay.
Velocity followed Oren’s gaze.
“I think we made it angry.”
Oren blinked at them.
Then looked back at the IDON.
“Crazy that it can spit out that weird membrane.”
He paused.
“Why didn’t it just do that in the first place?”
Binyelum said, “Probably takes a long time to regenerate.”
They paused.
“Our friend probably has a much harder time eating, too.”
Oren nodded.
“Makes sense.”
He paused.
“Think we could go for the legs?”
He paused again.
“It can’t scoop us up or anything.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“It saw my gift, lost its primary mode of attack, and hasn’t backed down. Even if it’s bluffing, I don’t wanna risk it. So–”
Binyelum shrugged.
“We just have to run like prey.”
Oren narrowed his eyes.
“That kind of sounds like bullshit.”
Binyelum blinked.
“What?”
Oren shook his head.
“You drove us underneath once already. Gimme a shot. I’ll hit the angle, get three legs on the–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“The point is to get away.”
Oren grunted.
A sound filled the cabin.
A lonely trumpet that burst into shimmering flickers.
Everyone blinked.
Dr. Satelleyez.
Goosebumps prickled Jhansi’s skin.
The doctor said, “Hey bedlights.”
She paused.
“Spinning through with a little push.”
Another pause.
“Hard traffic.”
Another version of the jingle played.
The doctor said, “Spec yourselves near the river. Something wicked came through Bridgemall. Shut down the food court.”
Another pause.
“All the way down. Into the river.”
Another pause.
“Gonna need a detour if that’s on your journey.”
Another pause.
“Soundwaves say the big boy’s on the move. Keep your specs up.”
Her voice took on a strange edge.
“Run run run little rabbits. I know you can make it free.”
It sounded like she smiled.
“Silent night no more, little bedlights.”
One final pause.
“Stars are coming out. Dazzle me.”
The jingle ushered out the doctor.
The radio went silent.
Oh!
Wow!
Oren said, “Wow.”
Velocity said, “Thanks mom.”
Jhansi said, “Holy shit! That’s us!”
Bineylum beamed.
“We’re on the airwaves already.”
Sebastian interrupted.
“Strawberri Eight.”
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
The Strawberri Eight Tower, a fixture of the St. Alëmskaan’machi waterfront skyline, had served the city as a Strawbridge & Clothier department store for the better part of six decades, prior to its current status and occupants. Built during the mid-century postwar boom, the angular eight-story building had ingratiated itself with the community as a symbol of prosperity in the new world. In 1996 the May Department Stores Company acquired Strawbridge & Clothier but left all stores operating under their original brand names, a maneuver typical for the company. A decade later Federated Department Stores acquired the May Department Stores Company with the intention of consolidating the company’s hundreds of disparate stores under the Macy’s brand name. Renowned east coast entrepreneur Lib Saito purchased the St. Alëmskaan’machi Strawbridge & Clothier building from Federated Department Stores during the rebranding. The building underwent a considerable renovation with the intention of attracting jobs in the meteoric technology industry. In accordance with Ms. Saito’s legendary frugality, the building’s new name came from a reorganization of the preexisting signage, with the i left in place of a y, because it seemed like it suited the industry.
What did that have to do with any of this?
Everyone turned to look at Sebastian.
Binyelum looked back at the road.
“Strawberri Eight?”
Velocity opened their mouth, but Binyelum held up a finger.
Binyelum said, “The building with the Adidas store?”
Sebastian nodded.
“Yeah, the one with the Adidas store.”
Velocity looked at Sebastian’s shoes.
“The traitor was you all along!.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“That’s how we can escape.”
Velocity said, “I don’t think a pair of Ultraboosts will–”
Sebastian interrupted.
“There’s a tunnel.”
Binyelum glanced at Sebastian, then looked back at the road.
They smiled into the rearview mirror.
“Well.”
They paused.
“I didn’t know that.”
Sebastian nodded.
“I don’t think a lot of people do. There’s a freight rail that runs underground, from the building to the docks. It was built back in like the forties or whatever, when the Strawberri Eight was a department store. Made it easy to transport all that furniture. Especially since the building’s already so close to the waterfront.”
Binyelum’s smile expanded.
“How in the hell do you know this, Sebastian?”
Sebastian sighed.
So softly that Jhansi could barely hear it.
He shrugged.
“I learned about it.”
Binyelum paused.
Then shrugged.
“I’m glad you did. You know where the entrance to the tunnel is?”
Sebastian nodded.
“Yeah.”
He paused.
“You’re familiar with the Strawberri Eight?”
Binyelum gestured at the air.
“There’s those two big staircases on either side of the atrium, leading up to a mezzanine. The entrance to the Adidas store is on the mezzanine. There’s more floors above, but I don’t know what’s up there.”
Sebastian nodded.
“Cool. You know those two big glass elevators at the back? On the ground floor, there’s a set of double doors along the wall left of the elevators. They’re big, way wider than what you’d expect. I think there’s a locked chain looped through the handles. Behind those doors is a rickety ass elevator. It’ll take you down into the tunnel.”
Binyelum squeezed the steering wheel.
“How wide is the shaft? How deep is it? Can we squeeze in if I blow it open with my gift?”
Velocity giggled.
Binyelum ignored them.
“Can we land safely?”
Sebastian nodded again.
“Mambele could for sure fit on the elevator. The drop is maybe twelve feet? Maybe a little more? Probably not safe, but, y’know.”
He shrugged.
“Plus, we’re already headed that way.”
Binyelum’s laugh sparkled.
“Fuck yes.”
They nodded.
“We can fucking do this.”
They nodded again.
“We’re going to make it.”
They paused.
“Imagine what the doctor will have to say about this.”
Light winked off their wide grin.
They squeezed the steering wheel.
They looked over their shoulder out the rear window.
“Do your fucking worst.”
Their eyes shot wide.
“Pejudo!”
Jhansi whipped around.
The IDON’s pylons glowed bright.
The water membrane had not yet regenerated, so, what?
What the fuck?
Binyelum lurched onto the brakes.
Sebastian’s barbell banged Jhansi in the head.
Something flickered above Mambele.
The roadway just beyond the hood fucking detonated.
Fuck!
Shrapnel battered the sedan.
What the fuck?!
Binyelum shifted their weight onto the accelerator and pulled hard on the steering wheel.
Mambele’s right side bounced brutally against the shattered asphalt.
Jhansi screamed, “What the fuck was that?”
Oren shouted, “A ranged attack? The fuck is that thing?”
Jhansi stared at the IDON.
Its pylons had dimmed again, but clearly they didn’t take long to recharge.
Jhansi replayed in her mind the jump at the bridge.
The mechanics of what had happened began to click into place.
Binyelum said, “Technically no, not a ranged attack. Just a really clever forcefield. Or something like that.”
They gestured.
“Those pylons generate some kind of energy field. Our friend uses it to manipulate that water membrane.”
They snapped their fingers.
“And apparently, there’s more.”
Jhansi leaned forward and nodded.
“It can build up an excess of that energy and then express it all at once. At really high velocities.”
Velocity said, “Hey, that’s me!”
Jhansi continued.
“When it ejaculated that water membrane, that was really just a side effect.”
Velocity laughed, mildly hysteric.
“Ejaculated!”
Sebastian gave them a look.
“Dude, we’re gonna fucking die.”
Oren said, “Why does it bother with that water stuff? Why not just shoot everyone all the time?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Harder to feed? Exponential refractory periods? It enjoys the element of surprise?”
Oren nodded.
“All of the above, probably.”
Velocity slapped the back of Binyelum’s seat.
“Love the biology lesson, truly. Real fucking great. But seriously, how the fuck are we going to make it to the Strawberri Eight? You’re out of shares and that thing’s gonna kill us with an invisible fucking laser beam.”
Oren said, “Forcefield.”
Velocity gestured at their crotch.
“Force this field!”
Binyelum shook their head.
“It’s a tight one for sure.”
Velocity raised both eyebrows.
Binyelum shrugged.
“The situation.”
They paused.
“I need another memory card.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum looked at her in the rearview mirror.
“Round two, princess.”
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh no not again.
Static threatened.
Jhansi looked around the cabin.
Fuck.
Had the jump sucked any of the shards out the window?
Static exploded.
Jhansi gritted her teeth.
“I …”
Binyelum blinked.
Jhansi gestured.
“My bag emptied when you made the jump.”
Sebastian opened his mouth, but Velocity slapped his shoulder.
Binyelum blinked again.
They shrugged.
“The difficulty only goes in one direction.”
Velocity laughed dryly.
Binyelum snapped their fingers and pointed at Nancy.
“Keep an eye on the alterling. Let me know when those pylons start glowing.”
They gestured around the cabin.
“Everyone else, help Jhansi find those shards.”
Everyone?
Fuck.
Jhansi’s stomach tightened.
“We need to find every piece, Binyelum. What if we can’t make it by the time we reach the Strawberri Eight?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That tunnel is our best chance of survival. Everyone’s gonna help. We’re gonna make it.”
Jhansi scowled.
“But–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“We’re almost at 44th. Don’t waste any more time.”
A red nebulite washed over Mambele.
Jhansi looked at her friends.
Oren nodded.
Velocity smirked.
Sebastian looked at her with bewilderment.
Nancy stared straight at her.
Fuck.
Sparks flickered and ebbed throughout Jhansi’s interior space.
She swallowed.
Right.
Round two.
They could do this.
Jhansi nodded.
“Right.”
Nancy leaned over the seat and pinned the IDON in her gaze.
Jhansi glanced around.
Okay.
Where could the shards have landed?
She couldn’t possibly check everywhere in time.
She needed the help.
And to make sure nobody got in anyone else’s way.
Everyone needed an assignment.
Jhansi turned to Velocity.
“Check the package shelf.”
Velocity blinked.
“Princess is giving instructions.”
Ugh.
Jhansi turned to Oren.
“Check the floor. Under Velocity’s seat, your seat, and Sebastian’s.”
Oren nodded.
Easy.
Jhansi looked at Sebastian.
“Check the seats, down into the upholstery and shit.”
Sebastian blinked at her.
“And what, you’re just gonna sit on your throne?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She didn’t reply.
Instead she leaned forward over the center console to scan the front of the cabin.
Everyone else moved around her.
Jhansi checked the coin tray.
Three more shards!
Three small shards, but still.
A good start.
Jhansi left them in place for now.
She checked in the crevices around the shifter.
Nothing.
Hm.
Jhansi looked at Nancy.
She stared resolutely out the rear window.
Jhansi needed to check her seat.
Uh.
Jhansi touched the seat next to Nancy.
Nancy blinked at her.
Jhansi blinked back.
“Uh …”
Nancy nodded, shifted her legs, and returned her focus to the IDON.
Velocity said, “Hey, uh, there’s nothing back here.”
Fuck.
Of course.
Jhansi could have just checked herself.
Wasted decision.
Static blistered.
Jhansi tried to think of another instruction to give.
Too much time.
No static.
Wait.
The other way around.
Fuck!
Jhansi gritted her teeth.
She pushed a hand beneath Nancy’s legs and between the seat cushion and backrest.
Nothing.
Fuck!
Oren said, “Found one.”
Jhansi whipped around.
Oren held a shard about the size of a nickel between his thumb and forefinger.
Fuck!
All these small pieces!
And only one on the floor?
Fuck!
Jhansi said, “That’s it?”
Oren shrugged.
“I’ll reach deeper under the seats.”
Fuck!
Jhansi tensed her neck.
She leaned forward and upended herself searching in the passenger’s side footwell.
She had to find something down there.
Nancy slapped Binyelum’s shoulder.
Fuck.
Binyelum crushed the accelerator.
Jhansi tipped back against Nancy.
Binyelum pulled the handbrake.
Jhansi tipped forward into the footwell.
Binyelum pulled the steering wheel to the right.
Jhansi tipped back against Nancy.
Mambele drifted through the next intersection.
Another red nebulite passed overhead.
The road behind them exploded.
Fuck!
Binyelum released the handbrake and floored the accelerator.
The IDON collided with another building.
Glass and shrapnel erupted.
The alterling pushed itself away from the building and after the Asterlings.
Oren said, “Fuck.”
He paused.
“I dropped it.”
What?!
Bineylum said, “Five blocks west of 33rd.”
They paused.
“We’re taking a little detour. We’ve got time.”
Velocity shouted, “Unless that thing fucking shoots us!”
Binyelum nodded.
“True.”
Fuck!
Jhansi pushed against the footwell to lift herself up.
Her hand brushed against something sharp and hard.
Fuck.
Yes.
Maybe the size of a quarter?
Jhansi said, “I’ve got a small collection going.”
She dropped the shard into the coin tray with the others.
Mambele pulled into another intersection.
Binyelum drifted through.
Jhansi fell back into Sebastian’s lap.
She blinked up at him.
He blinked down at her.
The sedan accelerated toward the Strawberri Eight.
Sebastian silently extended a fist.
Jhansi held out a palm.
Sebastian deposited two small shards into her gasp.
One about the size of a dime, the other vaguely trapezoidal and fairly large.
Yes.
Maybe they already had enough.
Jhansi said, “Velocity! Help Oren find that piece!”
Velocity saluted.
Jhansi scooped the four shards out of the coin tray.
She scanned the contents of her hands.
Matched edges in her mind.
Built a pattern out of the pieces as fast as she could.
And.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
“It’s not enough!”
The whole center portion of the memory card remained missing.
Oren’s piece wouldn’t complete it.
Fuck!
Oren groped beneath Nancy’s seat.
Velocity searched between Oren’s seat cushion and backrest.
Sebastian stared at Jhansi with wide eyes bereft of any suggestions.
Jhansi screamed, “Fuck!”
She leaned over Binyelum’s seat.
“I need to check under your ass and in your footwell.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Nothing down there.”
“But–”
Binyelum shook their head again.
“I checked.”
Jhansi stared.
Binyelum shot her a sideways glance.
“You’re doing so well.”
They paused.
“You’re so close.”
They smiled.
“I know you can find it, princess.”
Fuck.
A light purple nebulite washed over Mambele.
Jhansi looked over her shoulder.
Out the rear windshield.
The galloping IDON loomed.
Jhansi looked back at Binyelum.
Binyelum’s throat bobbed once beneath the hard line of their jaw.
Okay.
Jhansi sat back down.
She looked again at the contents of her hand.
Six memory card shards.
Three of them fit together to form the top left corner. Two more fit together to form the top right corner. The final piece, longer and thinner than the others, formed the bottom right corner. Oren’s piece probably formed the bottom left corner.
The entire center of the memory card remained missing.
Yeah.
Jhansi knew that.
Her eyes bulged.
Where hadn’t she looked?
What hadn’t she understood about the space around her?
Jhansi again scanned the cabin.
No, not the cabin.
Mambele.
Jhansi scanned Mambele.
She admired Mambele.
She admired the worn, piebald upholstery deforming softly to accommodate the panicking Asterlings.
And the overhead constellation, patterned as though in motion, all its stars converging toward the center. 
And the warm purple light radiating from the shifter to illuminate Binyelum’s arm.
And that weirdly enticing coloring book stashed in the pouch behind the driver’s seat.
The coloring book.
The title had changed slightly.
SO?
Oh.
Fuck.
Of course.
Jhansi reached for the coloring book.
Oren reached beneath Bineylum’s seat.
Velocity reached for Jhansi’s canvas bag.
Sebastian reached for Nancy.
Jhansi opened the coloring book.
At random.
A thirteen-point star dominated the verso. Liquid fountained from the center of the star and poured down the bottommost points. A large eyeball stared upward beneath the star, its pupil a wide receptacle. All this, rendered in a stained glass motif.
A glittering obelisk towered impenetrable on the recto. A calm lake reflected the hovering structure, as well as the thin crescent of the moon. In the background, coniferous trees receded toward distant mountains. All this, rendered in watercolor brushstrokes.
A massive memory card shard sat between the two pages.
Oh fuck!
Yes!
Fuck!
Yes!
Holy fuck!
Yes!
Jhansi slid it into place against the others.
And almost filled in the entire center.
Shit.
Not the whole thing.
Oren pulled a shard from deep beneath Binyelum’s seat and triumphantly held it aloft.
Oh fuck!
Yes!
Jhansi beamed, grabbed the shard from Oren, and slid it into place against the others.
And almost filled in the bottom left corner.
Shit!
Not the whole thing!
Velocity pulled a shard from the depths of Jhansi’s canvas bag and triumphantly held it aloft.
Fuck!
Yes!
Jhansi sighed, grabbed the shard from Velocity, and slid it into place against the others.
And filled in the entire center.
Fucking shit!
Still not enough!
Sebastian pulled a shard from the dark fount of Nancy’s hair and triumphantly held it aloft.
Holy fuck!
Yes!
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
Blood rushed in her ears.
She grabbed the shard from Sebastian and slid it into place against the others.
She went lightheaded.
Her body felt electric.
And a little nauseated.
Holy fuck.
Holy fuck.
Holy fuck!
Jhansi had done it.
Everyone had done it!
The Asterlings all looked at each other.
Nobody spoke.
Bineylum said, “Eleven blocks.”
A heady grin broke out across Jhansi’s face.
She leaned forward and draped her arms dramatically around Binyelum’s neck.
“Oh brave and fearless leader.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They stared at Jhansi.
An indecipherable expression passed across their face.
They grinned.
“Told you.”
Jhansi smirked.
“I want a new title.”
Binyelum blinked.
“You want a new title because you cleaned up your own mess? Princess took a liking to the maidling lifestyle?”
Oh come on.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“Just open your fucking mouth.”
Binyelum laughed.
Then complied.
They spread their mouth wide. Their lips parted reluctantly. The soft buds of flesh clung together, then distended slightly before separating with a snap.
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum lolled out their tongue, wet with saliva.
A bead dripped down onto their jacket.
Heat poured out from their throat.
Jhansi blinked a thousand fucking times.
Jhansi blushed so hard it hurt.
Fuck!
She just had to go and get cute, huh?
Jhansi brought her hands to Binyelum’s mouth and fed them the shards.
Binyelum’s jaw worked methodically.
Jhansi watched every movement.
Velocity said, “Fuck.”
They paused.
“I want a title now.”
Bineylum swallowed the memory card.
“If we make it through this, everyone gets a title.”
Velocity slapped the back of Binyelum’s head.
“They’re not special if everyone has one!”
Binyelum snorted.
“Everything’s special.”
Mambele rushed across first street and into the parking lot of the Strawberri Eight.
The building loomed stoic against an empty skyline.
Yes!
Nancy slapped Bineylum’s arm.
Wait.
Jhansi turned.
Fuck!
The IDON’s pylons glowed bright.
Velocity shouted, “Holy shit!”
Mambele hit the wide, shallow stairway leading up to the foyer of the Strawberri Eight.
Headlight luminescence outlined the marble steps, shone through the glass entryway doors, and glared against the atrium’s slanted glass ceiling.
Binyelum’s laugh chimed.
They squeezed the steering wheel.
Their mouth broke into a leer.
“All or nothing.”
Velocity shouted something else.
Mambele cleared the stairs fast enough to catch air.
The IDON’s pylons flashed.
The energy field carved a sizzling line through the air.
Mambele smashed through the entryway doors.
Glass sparkled.
The energy field hit.
The sound split Jhansi’s ears.
Shrapnel filled the world outside.
Headlight radiance reflected off every spinning particle.
How much time had passed since Jhansi’s last breath?
How long had each moment lasted?
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
The heart of a whirlwind galaxy.
They stood fully out of their seat.
Their knuckles white against the worn plastic steering wheel.
Their bottomless pupils widening to reflect the light from every false star.
Their lips pulled back across a cage of teeth in a vivid display of mania.
Fuck.
Jhansi’s heart.
Fucking ached.
Mambele hit the floor of the atrium.
And bludgeoned past the security desk.
The wide hemisphere of the atrium stretched forward.
The glass ceiling slanted away.
The IDON obliterated the remnants of the entryway.
It charged into the atrium.
The ceiling began to buckle.
Oh fuck.
Mambele’s headlights found the glass elevators at the far end of the atrium. 
The ceiling splintered.
Mambele battered aside tables and chairs as it closed the distance across the atrium.
The ceiling disintegrated.
Mambele blasted through a directory kiosk.
A sheet of glass shards rained into the atrium.
Velocity shouted, “Fuck!”
Sebastian leaned forward and pointed.
“There!”
Binyelum pulled the steering wheel.
The IDON filled the world right behind.
Mambele passed beneath an escalator.
She grazed the plaster and chipped off a chunk.
The IDON demolished the entire structure.
Binyelum shouted, “Nancy!”
Nancy leaned out the window and reached her arm forward, palm open and grasping at headlight luminescence.
Debris battered her body.
Binyelum delivered their full weight onto the accelerator.
They laughed, barking, probably not even aware of their human self.
Oren shouted, “Incoming! Left!”
Binyelum pulled the wheel.
Mambele lurched.
One of the IDON’s legs stabbed into the floor alongside the sedan, close enough for Nancy to touch.
Nancy flourished and dragged her palm along the smooth surface of the limb.
Holy fuck.
Velocity shouted something incoherent.
Mambele’s headlights illuminated a pair of wide doors held closed by a small, locked chain.
Sebastian's pointing finger pinned the doors in place.
Binyelum pulled the handbrake and leaned hard on the steering wheel.
They grabbed Nancy’s free hand.
Their headband pulsed and dimmed.
The screech of wailing tires filled Jhansi's ears.
Mambele hit the doors.
But first.
Nancy's arm exploded.
The golden fox rushed forward.
Its gnashing teeth rended the doors to the freight elevator.
Mambele skidded through.
The golden fox annihilated the elevator’s steel carriage.
Then poured down into the shaft.
And dissipated.
The open chasm swallowed Mambele.
The IDON descended.
Two massive armored legs smashed into everything.
Their violent momentum forced open fissures in the walls of the shaft.
Mambele hit the ground.
Jhansi’s teeth clacked together.
Binyelum pulled the steering wheel and stepped on the accelerator.
Mambele groaned free of the shaft.
Debris deluged.
Binyelum shouted, “Fuck!”
A sliver of silence.
Mambele lurched forward.
The IDON smashed down with even greater force.
Debris exploded into darkness.
Mambele battered her way forward.
The debris couldn't reach her.
The IDON smashed down again.
The debris couldn't reach Mambele.
Wait.
Holy shit.
The debris couldn't reach Mambele!
The IDON smashed down again, the sonorous boom already fainter behind the Asterlings.
Holy shit.
Then.
Other sounds of destruction.
The IDON fucking leveled the rest of the atrium.
Holy fuck.
Holy fuck.
Holy fuck.
Then.
Silence.
And the sound of ragged breathing.
Whose?
Fuck.
Nancy!
Sebastian broke the silence.
“Nancy!”
He grabbed Nancy's wrist and squeezed.
“Fuck, I’m so sorry!”
He looked around, his wavering eyes and open-mouthed grimace a mask of panic.
“I can't share my gift!”
The colors of his flower crown remained resolutely dimmed.
Binyelum turned.
They blinked.
They placed a hand on Nancy's shoulder.
“You're alright, yeah?”
Nancy ground her teeth together.
She pulled her hand from Sebastian's grip.
And grabbed the splintered stump of her arm.
Blood poured between her fingers.
It soaked into her jacket.
Her eyes burned dark.
She looked at Binyelum.
Hissed slow.
And nodded.
Sebastian looked at his hand, then reached back and slapped Binyelum across the face.
“She just lost her fucking arm, you asshole!”
Binyelum blinked.
Oren and Jhansi screamed, “Sebastian!”
Velocity shouted, “Dude!”
Binyelum brought a hand to their cheek.
They blinked again.
“You hit me?”
Sebastian balled his hand into a fist.
“She fucking lost her arm!”
Binyelum looked between Sebastian and Nancy.
“Heal her after your refractory period is up.”
They paused.
“She can endure.”
Sebastian looked furiously bewildered.
“My gift has a time limit, you absolute fucking turdfuck. The same length as my refractory period!”
Binyelum blinked.
They furrowed their brows.
“Time limit?”
Sebastian grabbed the back of Binyelum’s seat and shook it.
“I can’t fucking heal anyone after three minutes!”
Binyelum blinked.
Nancy shuddered.
She laughed silently.
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
“Why didn’t I know this?”
Sebastian snarled and tensed.
“I fucking–”
He punched the ceiling.
“–told you! Back at the diner!”
Binyelum’s mouth hardened into a perfectly straight line.
They exhaled.
They looked at Nancy.
“People just don’t love anymore.”
Sebastian pushed Jhansi off his lap.
“Fuck you!”
Hey what the fuck?!
Jhansi shouted, “What the fuck?!”
Sebastian leaned past everyone, grabbed the driver's side door handle, and threw open the door.
Binyelum blinked.
Sebastian popped the driver's side seat forward, pushed it down onto Binyelum, and clambered outside.
Oren shouted, “Sebastian!”
Velocity looked at Nancy.
“Fuck.”
Jhansi’s head pounded.
What the fuck?
What?
Why?
What?
Sebastian stumbled into the tunnel, turned, grabbed Binyelum’s jacket with both hands, and pulled them out of their seat.
Oren climbed over Jhansi to follow Sebastian.
Velocity yelled, “You fucking idiots!”
They pushed themselves into the driver’s seat.
“Nancy’s gonna fucking bleed out!”
Sebastian held the neck of Binyelum’s jacket in one hand.
He balled the other into a fist and pistoned his arm backward.
Binyelum gave him a strange smile.
Oren stumbled toward them.
Nancy grabbed the back of Velocity’s neck and pulled.
Velocity turned.
Their white eyes flashed.
Nancy stared.
She hissed.
Nancy jerked a finger at the stump of her arm, then pointed toward the front of Mambele.
She jerked her thumb up.
Then mimed slapping and rubbing the stump of her arm.
What the fuck?
What the hell did that mean?
Velocity blinked.
“Fuck.”
Nancy nodded.
Velocity blinked again.
They plunged out into the tunnel.
Their pendant glittered.
Sebastian roared something incoherent.
He threw his arm forward as hard as he could.
And caught Binyelum squarely across the jaw.
Binyelum buckled.
Sebastian’s grip kept them from falling completely.
Oren grabbed Sebastian from behind and locked his arms away from his body.
Binyelum stumbled.
They blinked.
They rubbed their jaw.
The smile reappeared.
Velocity clawed their way over Mambele's hood.
They pulled open Nancy's door.
Both of them stared at each other.
Nancy nodded.
Velocity blinked.
They leaned past Nancy and popped Mambele's hood.
Jhansi's vision blurred.
Static throttled her interior space.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Sebastian shouted, “Fuck you!”
He threw a kick at Binyelum.
Binyelum casually pushed it aside.
Sebastian screamed, “Fuck!”
Oren tightened his grip.
Velocity pulled Nancy from Mambele.
Nancy swayed.
Then snarled.
And righted herself.
Velocity blinked at her, then stared.
Then lifted Mambele’s hood fully open.
What?
Jhansi yelled, “Binyelum!”
Binyelum ignored her.
They stepped up to Sebastian.
Their weird smile widened.
They leaned in toward Sebastian.
Sebastian flinched.
Binyelum snickered.
Sebastian growled.
“Man, fuck you!”
Binyelum leered.
“You really don't think I'll hit you back, do you?”
Sebastian blinked.
Then growled.
“Didn't do anything to those assholes at Bridgemall.”
Binyelum stared.
Then slowly shook their head.
They looked at Oren.
“I really shouldn't hit him, right?”
Oren tightened his grip further.
He said nothing.
Binyelum clicked their tongue.
They looked back at Sebastian.
“What are you so mad about?”
Jhansi couldn’t see Velocity, but she heard them yell.
“Hey dipshits!”
Their tone hardened.
“Does anyone have a belt?”
Sebastian tried to kick Binyelum again.
Binyelum blocked it.
Almost playfully.
Velocity shouted, “For fuck’s sake.”
They paused.
“Jhansi!”
Huh?
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity shouted, “Get your ass out here! Bring that fucking bag!”
Oh.
Shit.
What?
Yes.
The bag.
The canvas bag.
Go.
Jhansi scrambled forward.
Sebastian yelled, “I’m mad about you! About your whole fucking deal!”
Binyelum blinked.
Then gestured theatrically at themselves.
“My deal?”
Sebastian kicked.
Binyelum blocked it.
Sebastian growled through a scream.
“Mister Fucking Good Guy!”
Binyelum snorted.
“That's how you see me?”
Jhansi hurried around to the front of Mambele.
The sound of bells rumbled from the open hood.
Velocity pointed at Jhansi’s canvas bag.
“Empty it.”
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity said, “Now.”
Sebastian said, “You and your fucking ego trip.”
He struggled against Oren.
“I'm fucking done with your suicide crusade!”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“Crusade?”
Jhansi grabbed the fire extinguisher from the canvas bag.
Velocity grabbed the bag and folded it in half.
Nancy opened her mouth.
What?
Velocity stuffed the bag between Nancy's teeth.
What?!
Sebastian sneered.
“I’m gonna find Kiran no matter what! I’m gonna new-game-plus every slack-jawed monsterfucker I find on the way! I’m gonna treat Jhansi like a little fucking baby because God forbid she develop a fucking–”
He kicked in Jhansi’s direction.
“–perspective on reality!”
What?!
Binyelum chuckled.
“What other impressions can you do that well? Don’t tell me the talent is wasted.”
Sebastian did scream this time.
“Fuck you!”
He inhaled.
“She–”
He gnashed his teeth in Jhansi's direction.
“Almost got me killed!”
He glared at Binyelum.
“This isn't a fucking game, Binyelum!”
He fought against Oren.
“We're going to fucking die!”
His tone pitched upward.
“Nancy lost her arm because of you!”
Binyelum stared at Sebastian.
Then looked over at Nancy.
Nancy stared back.
Her face held no expression.
Velocity grabbed Nancy’s torso with both arms.
Then looked into the open hood.
They paused.
“Pej.”
They looked at Jhansi.
“Get the vodka from the trunk.”
What?
Jhansi said, “What?”
Binyelum said, “You think we could have avoided this.”
Sebastian seethed.
“That’s what I fucking mean! It’s not about fucking avoiding it, Binyelum! This isn’t some fucking optimization game! This is fucking life and death. And we’re fucked. We’re worthless! We’re just a bunch of goddamned jergers, motherfucker! What the fuck do you think we can possibly do other than die?!”
Oren twisted his grip and Sebastian cried out.
Binyelum mouthed two words.
“Jergers. Wow.”
They shook their head.
They smiled.
“Sebastian. A friend of mine is in trouble.”
Sebastian blinked.
His lips curled.
He stomped hard onto the ground.
“You don’t even fucking know her!”
He struggled against Oren.
“Why should I give a fuck who she is?!”
Binyelum blinked.
A soft laugh pushed past their lips.
“You don’t really feel that way.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“Ugh.”
He groaned.
“God!”
He glared.
“Why are you like this?”
He shook his head.
“Of fucking course I don’t feel that way!”
He shook his head.
“But how can I fucking believe you when you treated Nancy like a fucking doll!”
Binyelum nodded.
“Right. Nancy.”
They looked toward Nancy.
Right past Jhansi.
Static thundered.
Velocity shouted, “Jhansi!”
Fuck.
Right.
Jhansi ran around to Mambele’s trunk.
Closed.
Of course.
Jhansi ran to the open driver’s side door and popped the trunk.
She ran back to the trunk.
Vodka.
She lifted the trunk fully open.
What did a bottle of vodka look like?
That, probably.
Jhansi grabbed a tall, fat bottle half filled with a clear liquid and wrapped with a blue label.
POPOV Premium Blend
Weird.
Jhansi hurried back around to the front of Mambele.
Nancy stared at Binyelum.
Blood poured from her wound.
She shivered, once.
Her teeth crushed against the canvas bag.
Binyelum glanced at Sebastian.
They shook their head.
“I don’t think you understand Nancy very well.”
Jhansi arrived with the bottle of vodka.
Velocity grabbed it.
“Thanks.”
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity twisted off the lid and upended the bottle over the engine.
The clear liquid sizzled.
Velocity stopped pouring.
They splashed vodka on Nancy’s wound without warning.
Nancy bared her teeth and opened her mouth.
Her dark eyes flickered.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
What?
Velocity grabbed Nancy with bold hands.
They jerked Nancy around.
Both of them stared at each other.
Nancy shrugged.
Velocity pressed Nancy’s wound down against the engine.
Wait!
What?!
What the fuck?!
Nancy’s eyes shot wide open.
Her back stiffened.
She bucked.
Her left arm shot upward.
It hit the underside of the hood.
Then jerked down and found Velocity’s throat.
Nancy squeezed.
Velocity’s face went red.
The meat of Nancy’s burning wound snapped and charred.
Blood sizzled and bubbled on the engine block.
Nancy’s teeth mashed and frayed the canvas bag.
Nancy’s eyes rolled back.
Velocity pulled Nancy away from the engine.
“Fuck!”
Sebastian screamed, “Fuck!”
He pulled hard against Oren.
He tried vainly to double over and throw Oren off his back.
He ground his teeth together and once again kicked at Binyelum.
“This is still your fucking fault!”
The kick caught Binyelum square in the small of their back.
Binyelum stumbled.
Fuck.
Sebastian’s expression shifted in a way Jhansi didn’t understand.
Binyelum turned.
A wicked menace flashed across their features.
They spoke in a flat tone.
“You hit me, because you feel powerless, because you can’t save Nancy.”
Sebastian blinked.
His expression hardened.
He opened his mouth, but Binyelum spoke first.
“You don’t know anything about her. Why the fuck should you care what happens to her?”
Sebastian blinked again.
His expression shifted again, in a different way from before.
Binyelum spoke first.
“Why the fuck do you care about a fucking jerger, Sebastian?”
Sebastian ground his teeth together.
His brows curved down to a sharp point.
The veins in his neck swelled.
“Because my friends left me to die, Binyelum!”
Binyelum blinked.
Oren blinked too.
So did Jhansi.
Velocity shouted, “Morons!”
Everyone turned.
Velocity glared at Binyelum.
“Nancy’s fucked up!”
Binyelum leapt forward without a word.
Sebastian shouted, “Fuck!”
Oren hesitated, then released Sebastian.
They both pelted toward Nancy.
Jhansi stared.
She clutched her fire extinguisher against her chest.
Everyone crowded around Nancy.
Jhansi looked from face to face.
Velocity lowered Nancy to the ground.
Binyelum leaned over her.
Only the whites of Nancy’s eyes showed.
Binyelum said, “Fuck.”
They looked around.
“Is she in shock?”
Velocity punched Binyelum’s shoulder.
“You’re supposed to know that shit!”
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“I’m a captain, not a trained medical professional.”
Sebastian reared back as though to kick Mambele’s front bumper.
Oren gave him a look.
Nancy vomited.
She blinked.
And looked around.
Velocity knelt beside her.
“Fuck!”
They reached tentatively toward Nancy’s charred wound.
They stopped shy of touching it.
Nancy’s chest heaved gently.
Binyelum knelt.
“You’re okay?”
Nancy blinked.
She giggled.
And licked her lips.
Her mouth bent into a strange smile.
She shrugged.
Then nodded.
Binyelum shook their head.
“Fuck.”
They leaned closer to Nancy’s wound.
They sighed.
“You’re insane.”
Nancy giggled again.
Sebastian shook his head.
“Jesus.”
Binyelum looked Nancy in the eye.
“You’re okay to stand?”
Nancy paused.
She shook her head.
Binyelum nodded.
“Let me know if you need anything, okay?”
Nancy nodded.
Binyelum straightened.
They turned to Oren.
Oren nodded.
They both turned to Sebastian.
Sebastian blinked.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Fuck indeed.”
Oren glared.
He gestured around at the tunnel.
Bright splashes of graffiti coated the curved concrete walls.
Wet eyes, drooling mouths, severed limbs, and gibbering symbolic esoterica receded into the darkness beyond Mambele’s headlights.
A shiver ran down Jhansi’s spine.
Voyeurs.
Oren said, “How’s this look for a fucking coffin?”
Sebastian blinked again.
“What?”
Binyelum put a hand on Oren’s shoulder.
“I think what Captain Carried-Away means is–”
Binyelum’s tone hardened a single degree.
“–explain yourself.”
Sebastian’s mouth fell into a flat line.
“Right.”
Oren crossed his arms.
“Jerger?”
He raised his eyebrows.
“Really?”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“It just came out.”
Oren punched Sebastian in the shoulder.
Sebastian stumbled.
“Fuck!”
Oren shrugged.
“It just came out.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes again.
Binyelum smiled.
“I’m actually not the one you need to worry about hitting you.”
Sebastian rubbed his shoulder.
“Fuck.”
He glared at Oren.
Binyelum said, “Now, young man, tell us where you learned a word like that.”
Sebastian glanced down at Nancy.
Nancy stared back with impassive eyes.
Sebastian sighed.
He turned away and stared down toward the end of the tunnel.
“Wanna know how I knew this was here?”
Velocity rolled their eyes.
“Not this.”
Binyelum shot them a look.
Velocity shrugged.
Sebastian ignored them both.
“I was a naval endling before last night.”
Huh?
Binyelum whistled.
Oren stared.
Velocity said, “Of course.”
Nancy remained impassive.
Jhansi said, “What?”
Bineylum walked around to look Sebastian in the eye.
“Rank? Faction?”
Sebastian shrugged.
“Black.”
He paused.
“Full.”
What?
Binyelum whistled again.
Oren huffed.
“Full.”
Velocity said, “Well that’s unexpected.”
Nancy remained impassive.
Jhansi said, “Full? What’s that?”
Sebastian snorted.
Oren turned to Jhansi.
“There are five different endling factions.”
He held up the fingers on his left hand in sequence.
“Full. Gibbous. Quarter. Crescent. New.”
Huh.
Makes sense.
Jhansi nodded.
But then, wait.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Full is bad?”
Sebastian tensed.
Binyelum shook their head.
“I don’t want to get into this right now.”
Sebastian relaxed.
Huh.
Fine.
But then, wait.
Jhansi shook her head.
“What’s a naval endling?
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
Oren said, “Exactly what it sounds like.”
Oh.
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
“Endlings have boats?”
Oren nodded.
“Trucks. Boats. Planes.”
He paused.
“Space shuttles.”
What the hell?
That didn't seem fair.
Jhansi said, “What? Why? How?”
Oren shrugged.
“Transport vehicles. We dodged a truck during our getaway. There were probably a couple in the parking garages outside Bridgemall.”
A truck?
Oh.
Right.
That thing.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Huh.”
Oren nodded.
Sebastian pursed his lips.
“Is daycare over or what?”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
“Hey!”
Binyelum waved her away.
Ugh.
Binyelum looked pointedly at Sebastian.
“Sebastian, how’d you get boat duty?”
Velocity shrugged.
“You’re not really the type to ask for it.”
Sebastian shook his head.
“I didn’t ask for it.”
He gestured.
“It was just the fortune of the favor.”
Binyelum whistled yet again.
“A rare fate.”
What?
Jhansi said, “This sounds like something I’m supposed to understand.”
Sebastian groaned.
Oren said, “The favor. That’s when Egaeus grants a rank up.”
He gestured.
“On rare occasions things won’t go as expected, resulting in some accidental fortune.”
Sebastian huffed.
Jhansi made a face.
Bineylum said, “Sebastian, what happened with your favor?”
Sebastian nodded.
“My friend and I–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“Your friend?”
Sebastian paused.
“Yeah, my friend.”
Binyelum said, “Hm.”
Sebastian continued.
“We took down a gold that was auditioning for the gibbous navy.”
Bineylum raised their eyebrows and nodded.
“You were both purple at the time?”
Sebastian shook his head.
“I was purple. Michael was gold. I held off a purple and a green while he duked it out with the gold.”
Binyelum laughed.
They clapped once.
“You held off a purple and a green by yourself?”
Sebastian blushed.
“Is that so hard to believe?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No. Not at all.”
They smiled.
“It must have been important to you.”
Sebastian blushed deeper.
And scowled at the same time.
“Something like that.”
Binyelum watched him.
Then nodded.
“If Michael took down the gold, how’d you get included in the favor? Did he let you claim the memory card?”
Sebastian shook his head, then shrugged.
“I have no fucking idea.”
Binyelum nodded again.
They paused.
“So it’s like that.”
Wait.
Like what?
Jhansi said, “Like what?”
Binyelum shot her an incomprehensible glance.
Okay then.
Sebastian glared at Jhansi.
Binyelum kept their focus on Sebastian and stepped in front of Jhansi.
“He wanted you to come with?”
Sebastian didn’t say anything.
Binyelum nodded.
“Fair. So you both got put on boat duty, and–”
They paused and looked around.
“–you guys just stumbled across this tunnel?”
Sebastian nodded.
“Actually, yeah. Pretty much exactly that. We had disembarked to chase down some straggler special ones, lost them, but found a low caliber alterling, and chased it in here.”
Binyelum paused.
They spoke quietly.
“Is that how you died?”
Sebastian chuckled.
“You think some trash .32 auto alterling is gonna take down a squad of naval endlings? Even on my own I could’ve–”
Binyelum held up both hands.
“Everyone has bad days.”
Sebastian sighed.
He shrugged.
He shook his head.
“No, that’s not how I died.”
Binyelum said, “How did you die?”
Sebastian blinked.
“Right.”
He looked at the ground.
“That’s the whole reason I’m telling you all this.”
He looked up toward the ceiling.
He inhaled and exhaled slowly.
His mouth quirked into a soft frown.
“The Empty Chest.”
Huh?
Binyelum sucked in their breath.
Oren huffed.
“Fuck.”
Velocity said, “Pej.”
Nancy remained impassive.
Jhansi said, “The Empty Chest?”
Everyone ignored her.
Binyelum nodded softly.
“You have an interesting relationship with luck.”
Sebastian snorted.
“Sure.”
Binyelum stepped closer to Sebastian.
“Can I give you a hug?”
Sebastian glared.
He backed away a step.
“What?”
Binyelum stared.
“Your friends left you to die at the hands of the Empty Chest.”
Sebastian scowled.
He opened his mouth.
Then closed it again.
Oren nodded slowly.
“This makes sense.”
He paused.
“It’s not an excuse.”
He nodded again.
“But it makes sense.”
Huh?
How did any of this make sense?
Jhansi said, “What?”
Binyelum ignored her.
They held their arms open to Sebastian.
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
He sagged his shoulders.
He looked away.
Binyelum stepped forward and pulled Sebastian into a hug.
They squeezed.
Sebastian kept his eyes on the wall.
He spoke softly.
“It was pretty bad.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum stepped back and rested their hands on Sebastian’s shoulders.
They looked Sebastian square in the eyes.
“The Asterlings don’t leave their friends behind.”
Sebastian’s mouth slanted into a small smile.
He nodded.
Binyelum said, “If you say that word again, you will have to worry about me hitting you.”
They raised both eyebrows.
“And I won’t be nice like Oren.”
Sebastian looked at Oren.
Then back at Binyelum.
“I understand.”
Binyelum smiled.
“I’m glad we understand each other a little better.”
Their smile widened.
“You went through all that and came out a pentacles.”
They nodded.
“That’s something to be proud of.”
They looked around.
Oren, Velocity, and Jhansi stood watching.
Nancy hadn’t moved.
She remained impassive.
Binyelum nodded and knelt beside her.
“Hey killer. How are you doing?”
Nancy blinked slowly.
She shrugged.
Binyelum nodded again.
“Thank you for everything.”
Nancy said nothing.
Binyelum nodded yet again.
“Are you okay to keep going?”
Nancy shrugged again.
She rolled her eyes away from Binyelum.
Then looked back and nodded.
Sebastian frowned.
“You’re gonna make her keep fighting?”
Binyelum looked up at Sebastian.
“You think she’ll be happier on the sidelines?”
Sebastian blinked.
Nancy looked at Binyelum.
Sebastian looked at Nancy.
Nancy looked at Sebastian.
They both stared at each other.
Sebastian sighed.
And shrugged.
“Fine.”
He looked at Binyelum.
“Fine.”
Binyelum nodded.
They turned and addressed the Asterlings as a group.
“Okay.”
They clapped their hands together.
A strange smile crept across their face.
Headlight radiance danced in their eyes.
“Everybody ready?”
Jhansi exhaled.
Velocity smirked.
“For what, exactly?”
Bineylum gestured down the dark tunnel.
“To go.”
Velocity crossed their arms.
“Okay. Yeah. Where?”
Binyelum winked.
“Out.”
Velocity narrowed their eyes.
“Why won’t you tell us what’s next?”
Bineylum paused.
They looked around at everyone.
“This isn’t really the place to formulate a plan.”
They gestured at the tunnel.
“Liminal.”
They nodded.
“Let’s get a breath of fresh air and collect our thoughts. Once we feel more grounded, I’ll explain where we’re gonna find Kiran.”
Oren gave Binyelum a long look.
Velocity raised both eyebrows.
“Sure, I guess.”
Sebastian shrugged.
“Doesn’t make a difference to me.”
Nancy remained impassive.
Jhansi opened her mouth, but couldn’t think of anything to say.
How could she explain that she hadn’t understood any of that?
Binyelum reached and pulled the canvas bag from between Nancy’s teeth.
They handed it up to Jhansi.
Oh.
Right.
Jhansi blinked.
She grabbed the canvas bag.
Nancy nodded at Jhansi.
Jhansi blinked again.
She nodded back.
Binyelum bent as if to lift Nancy by supporting her beneath her arm.
Nancy shook her head.
She reached her arm upward.
Binyelum blinked, then stood and pulled Nancy up to her feet.
Nancy’s lips pulled back.
She teetered just once.
Then straightened.
She looked around at everyone.
Binyelum nodded.
They pulled down Mambele’s hood.
The sound reverberated down the tunnel.
The Asterlings filed back into Mambele.
Sebastian shouldered Jhansi.
“Keep your piss princess skirt offa me.”
What?!
Static stabbed straight into Jhansi.
Heat rose in her cheeks so fast that it hurt.
Jhansi looked down.
Fuck!
And everyone stood staring at her.
Double fuck!
A dozen more spears of static lanced through Jhansi.
She turned on Sebastian.
“Fuck you!”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“What an unexpected reaction.”
What?
Wait.
What the fuck did that mean?
Fuck!
Fuck!
Did everyone think of her that way?
Static hammered against Jhansi.
Fuck!
Jhansi stomped her foot.
Sebastian chuckled.
The static fucking screamed.
A thousand goddamned fucks!
Jhansi snarled.
“At least I didn’t fuck up Nancy’s arm.”
Sebastian’s eyes went dark.
He shoved Jhansi with both hands.
Fuck!
Jhansi stumbled.
Asshole!
Sebastian glared.
“You think I fucked that up?”
He snorted.
“You’re the dumbass who couldn’t even keep those cards in one piece.”
What the fuck?!
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Sebastian said, “You’re the dumbass who gave Tin Can back his hammer.”
Fuck!
Jhansi balled her fists.
Sebastian said, “I didn’t almost get you killed.”
Son of an absolute fucking bitch!
Jhansi screamed, “Yeah but you said a shitty word!”
Sebastian laughed.
“Poor me. I guess they’re going to send me to jail now.”
He sneered.
“As far as I can tell, you’re fucking worthless, and that’s a lot worse.”
Jhansi blinked.
Static squeezed and beat her senseless.
Fuck.
Worthless.
Did everyone see her that way?
Jhansi turned toward Binyelum.
Binyelum glanced at Jhansi.
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“Wow.”
They looked from Jhansi to Sebastian.
“That was something.”
Binyelum looked at Sebastian.
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“Here it fucking comes.”
Binyelum chuckled.
“I don’t baby Jhansi.”
They turned to Jhansi.
“That was fucked up, princess.”
What?
Jhansi’s breath caught in her throat.
The static stopped.
It hung imobile and flickering in place.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
What should she say?
She could make Binyelum understand.
Not worthless.
Not fucking worthless.
Jhansi pointed.
“He started it!”
Fuck!
Goddammit!
Binyelum laughed.
“Really?”
Jhansi scowled.
She looked away.
And crossed her arms.
“He made fun of me.”
Binyelum laughed again.
“Would you want somebody with a pissed-on skirt to sit in your lap?”
A single lance of static stabbed through Jhansi.
Jhansi clenched her teeth.
“Well no.”
Binyelum nodded.
“See? It’s not so hard.”
Water welled at the back of Jhansi’s eyes.
Fuck.
No.
Jhansi squeezed her eyes shut.
She looked at Binyelum.
She didn’t have anything to say.
Binyelum nodded.
They turned to Sebastian.
“Jhansi’s not worthless.”
What?
Jhansi blushed for no reason she understood.
Sebastian huffed.
He rolled his eyes.
“I know.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
Sebastian gestured.
“I know!”
Sebastian looked at Jhansi.
Ugh.
Nothing felt better.
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“Wow.”
They looked from Jhansi to Binyelum to Sebastian.
“That was something too.”
They paused.
“Jhansi still has to sit somewhere.”
Sebastian gestured.
“Make her sit by herself.”
Velocity said, “And get the seat wet?”
They shook their head.
“It’s not like she can just take off her skirt, either. Her panties are soaked too.”
What?!
What the fuck?!
Jhansi looked around in horror.
Oren stepped forward.
“Jhansi–”
He shook his head.
“–just sit in my lap.”
Fuck.
Ugh.
Jhansi blushed deep.
Binyelum giggled.
“We’ll find you some new pants, princess.”
Jhansi blushed even deeper.
Assholes.
All of them.
Jhansi tried to fold her skirt over to cover the stain as she sat in Oren’s lap.
Binyelum and Nancy pulled Mambele’s doors closed.
Binyelum shifted out of park.
They looked around the cabin.
“Okay. Chances the alterling is waiting outside for us? Thoughts?” 
Sebastian shook his head.
“Chances are pretty low. The tunnel lets out under an arched overhang. It’s kinda secluded, and there’s no hint about where it might lead. Even if it saw the opening, it would probably just move on.”
Binyelum nodded.
“So sayeth those who know.”
They stepped gently on the accelerator.
“Guess we’ll find out.”
Mambele straddled the rightmost rail as they thumped through the tunnel. The driver’s side bucked over each railroad tie. Beaming headlights pulled a stream of new graffiti into existence. The shapes swirled and shimmered just beyond the passenger’s side window, some of them turning to stare or grasp at Jhansi before disintegrating into the cloak.
What?
Binyelum said, “How long is this tunnel?”
Sebastian shrugged.
“Less than a mile?”
Binyelum clicked their tongue.
Nobody else spoke.
The silence stretched on.
It felt crushingly alien.
Jhansi curled in on herself.
Her entire body felt raw, outside and inside. Seething sensations vyed for her attention with no possible outlet. She tried to focus on one at a time and found it impossible.
She looked down.
And watched her hands shake.
Why?
What did that mean?
Why now, in the middle of this calm?
Oh.
Right.
Fuck.
They had survived.
Somehow, they had all survived.
How long ago had they embarked from the Washington Center?
Or The Rescue?
It felt like a thousand years.
It felt like a different lifetime.
Jhansi could barely remember what the world had looked like before this.
She ran back through her memory.
She saw the IDON crashing down closer and closer and closer to the sedan as it chased the Asterlings through the city.
She saw a teenager strangled and broken by a jellyfish, swallowed piece by piece by a monster, and converted into something else.
She saw endlings tearing each other apart in a sea of emerald glass, orange blood and white bones and glistening, pulpy stuff splattered across every sparkling surface.
She saw an alterling digesting the body of a teenager, methodically pulling the corpse deeper and deeper inside itself.
She saw Nancy, and Sebastian, and Velocity, and Oren.
She saw Binyelum.
Ugh.
Fucking.
Binyelum.
And that bullshit with Sebastian.
Whatever.
Jhansi tried to push the thought from her mind.
It didn’t work.
Many thoughts came to her mind.
Binyelum had kept the Asterlings alive.
Binyelum had defended her value.
Binyelum … had appeared at the last second to redirect the flow of imminent violence and save her fucking life.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked up.
Binyelum sat straight and drove with one large hand on the wheel.
Fuck.
They understood.
Her role.
The ultrarare specialing.
They must.
Nothing else made sense.
What else could her existence mean?
How else would she have managed to pull off that thing with the memory card shards?
That weird moment.
When everything had come together.
What had even happened?
Jhansi couldn’t remember.
Her mind had done something very strange.
And she’d solved an impossible puzzle and saved everyone’s life.
It felt like destiny.
She saw it plain.
As long as Binyelum kept her alive she could continue to call on that nameless power, solve every puzzle, get them to the moon, and unlock the secret to defeating Egaeus.
Binyelum would keep Jhansi alive.
Jhansi would save the world.
Perfect.
Velocity shifted.
They grunted.
They kept staring out the window.
“So Sebastian.”
They paused.
“Full, huh?”
They paused for slightly longer.
“What’s that like?”
Huh?
Jhansi looked up.
Sebastian laughed darkly.
“What do you think it’s like?”
Velocity looked at Sebastian.
“Let’s all come together?”
Sebastian mirrored Velocity’s expression.
“Like a circlejerk?”
Velocity snorted.
“If you’re into that.”
Sebastian gave a single, half-hearted laugh.
He went back to watching the graffiti.
“It’s pretty much what you’d expect.”
Velocity scowled.
They mirrored Sebastian and returned to watching the graffiti.
“Did you like it?”
Sebastian didn’t reply.
Velocity growled.
They kept staring out the window.
Sebastian said, “I don’t know.”
He kept staring out the window.
Velocity snorted.
“You don’t know?”
Sebastian turned to look at Velocity.
“No. I don’t know.”
Velocity turned to look at Sebastian.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
Binyelum looked at them both in the rearview mirror.
“Is there a problem?”
Velocity gestured.
“Ask the fascist over here.”
What?
Sebastian growled.
“I just wanted to be with my friends.”
He made a face.
“I …”
He set his hands in his lap.
“Was probably wrong about some things.”
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“You ranked up to black.”
They paused.
“That’s a good climb. That’s commitment.”
Sebastian narrowed his eyes.
“Execution is a powerful motivator.”
Double what?
Binyelum looked at Sebastian in the rearview mirror.
“You ever participate in the culling?”
Huh?
Sebastian chuckled darkly.
“No, I never participated in the culling.”
He shrugged.
“That’s a job for the sparklings.”
Binyelum nodded.
“You watched the culling.”
Sebastian paused.
Then shrugged.
“Yep.”
He paused again.
“Every night.”
Okay, what?
Jhansi said, “The culling?”
Oren nodded.
“The full faction culls its lowest performers at the end of every night.”
Jhansi frowned.
“What, they like, get kicked out?”
Sebastian laughed.
“No.”
He smiled.
“They get executed.”
Wait.
What?
What the hell?
Jhansi blinked.
“Executed?”
She paused.
“Like, killed?”
Sebastian laughed.
“As opposed to the execution that gives you a pair of wings and invincibility?”
Holy shit.
Jhansi looked around at everyone.
“That’s fucked up.”
She looked around again.
“Right?”
A tapestry of mixed expressions stared back at Jhansi.
Sebastian shrugged.
“It just is what it is.”
Jhansi frowned.
“You guys don’t fight back?”
Sebastian gave a smile that somehow looked both condescending and apologetic.
“We believe in it.”
Huh?
Waitaminute.
Jhansi blinked, then blinked again.
“What the fuck?”
Sebastian shrugged.
He sighed.
He straightened his back and spoke in a tone Jhansi had not heard him use before.
“An endling comes into existence for the purpose of pleasing Egaeus. An endling that cannot please does not have a purpose. An endling with no purpose has no reason to exist. Endlings with an empty existence are traitors to the legacy. We, the anointed full moon endlings, are destined for perfection in the eyes of our creator. We act, without hesitation or restraint, to eradicate our own imperfections. We are the truest. We are the favorite.”
Well.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
She closed it.
She blinked.
“Wow.”
Sebastian shrugged.
“It is what it is.”
Velocity glared.
“Seriously?”
Sebastian shrugged.
He made a face.
“It’s just a stupid thing people believe.”
He gestured.
“Everything people believe is stupid.”
Binyelum made a noise.
“So that’s why you’re here.”
Huh?
Sebastian blinked.
“What?”
His tone didn’t quite match his expression.
Binyelum nodded.
“I figured there had to be some reason that you ended up with us–”
They gestured around the cabin.
“–and not, say, the Final Hand.”
Sebastian glanced away.
He huffed, “Yeah.”
Wait.
What?
Velocity crossed their arms.
“I dunno.”
Sebastian gave them a look.
Velocity leaned back.
“I just don’t like it.”
Binyelum said, “I’m not a huge fan myself.”
Sebastian gave Binyelum a look.
Binyelum returned the look in the rearview mirror.
“But I trust Sebastian to do his best.”
Sebastian’s mouth fell into a flat line.
Sebastian looked out the passenger’s side window.
Velocity turned away too.
Binyelum said, “Looks like we’re here.”
Oh shit.
Binyelum flicked off Mambele’s headlights.
Crushing oppression overwhelmed the cabin.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked around.
Mambele passed beneath a slanted overhang.
The mouth of the tunnel released them back out into the night.
The curve of the moon slid into view.
The sussurus of rippling water mixed with Mambele’s bells.
Heavy shadows cast from spindly structures loomed near on the horizon.
Binyelum put Mambele in park.
They looked in the rearview mirror.
“Where are we?”
Sebastian leaned forward.
“These tracks meet up pretty quickly with another set that runs basically parallel to the waterfront. All this shit–”
He gestured at the web of shadows.
“–is storage or whatever. Elevators and silos, that kind of thing. There’s a port terminal that way–”
He pointed to the right, then froze.
Everyone followed his gesture.
Goldbar Bay rolled away into the night thirty meters or so down a slight incline, beyond the edge of a flat expanse of concrete. Twelve pairs of headlights cut through the scene at varying angles. The light revealed intricate patterns painted across the concrete. Curving dotted lines, multicolored ribbons running in parallel, boxes filled with words that Jhansi couldn’t read at this distance. A different language than the graffiti in the tunnel.
The diffuse radiance traced hundreds of stacked shipping containers arranged in an esoteric grid around the the terminal. Tall shadows reached back to merge with the cloak. Jhansi found it challenging to grasp the full geometry of it all.
Wait.
Not all the shipping containers sat neatly in stacks.
Three parallel stacks lay toppled, strewn, and smashed on the ground at the far end of the terminal.
Tidal splashes of red and orange coated the scene.
Goosebumps prickled Jhansi’s skin.
Something lay slumped across two of the toppled stacks.
A carcass.
A massive one.
The IDON.
Wait.
What?
The fucking IDON.
Dead.
Just like that.
What the fuck?
Bulky silhouettes crossed between the corpse of the IDON and the hemisphere of vehicles with quick, coordinated efficiency.
Binyelum shook their head.
They chuckled once.
“Figures.”
Ugh.
Jhansi leaned forward.
“Figures what?”
Binyelum gestured.
“Speak of the devil.”
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
Wait.
Jhansi should know.
Uh.
Jhansi brightened.
“Oh! The Final Hand!”
Wait.
Fuck.
More new people?
Ugh.
Fuck.
Jhansi said, “We’re teaming up?”
Binyelum scoffed.
“The Final Hand doesn’t team up.”
They paused.
“And I’m not interested.”
The rest of the Asterlings nodded.
Jhansi relaxed.
“Oh thank fuck.”
Everyone laughed.
Jhansi blushed.
Oren said, “It’s like Duet said. If anyone here had been the kind of person interested in the Final Hand, that’s where the daydreaming would have placed us. We wouldn’t be here.”
Huh.
Fascinating.
But then.
Jhansi frowned.
“So, what then?”
Velocity shrugged.
“Fuck ‘em.”
Binyelum rubbed their chin.
“No.”
Velocity raised both eyebrows.
“Well yeah, I don’t mean literally.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No.”
They paused.
“No. I want to know why they’re here.”
Velocity blinked.
“Why?”
They gestured.
“It’s because they killed Floater Island.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Nice one.”
They shook their head.
“No. I’m interested to know why they were here when–”
They paused.
“–Floater Island showed up.”
Velocity frowned.
“How do you know they were already here?”
Binyelum gestured.
“If they had chased it here there would be way more collateral damage.”
Velocity leaned back.
“Huh.”
Binyelum nodded.
“They were already here, so they were probably posted here. To protect something?”
They paused.
“I want to know what’s going on.”
Oren raised his eyebrows.
“You sure they’re going to tell us?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Worst that happens is they tell us to fuck off.”
They shook their head.
“But this is a weird night. I want to know what’s going on out there.”
Oren shrugged.
Sebastian said, “Maybe they’ll have some new pants for Jhansi.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Maybe they will indeed have some new pants for our little pissling.”
What?!
Pissling?!
Absolutely fucking not.
Jhansi shouted, “No!”
Binyelum turned to look at her.
They grinned.
“Not the new title you had in mind?”
Jhansi’s face burned.
She squeezed her hands tight.
Oren hissed.
Jhansi had grabbed onto one of his legs.
Fuck.
Jhansi let go.
She stared hard at Binyelum.
“Binyelum.”
A smile spread across Binyelum’s face.
It grew into a fully fledged grin.
No.
The razor edges of Jhansi’s stare flickered.
Binyelum blinked slowly.
They shrugged.
“The princess gets her way again.”
They paused.
“Maybe I do baby her.”
Jesus.
Of all the fucking things.
Jhansi made a face at Binyelum.
She rolled her eyes.
She looked around at everyone else.
“Do not fucking say anything.”
Oren looked completely passive.
Velocity said, “Nah, I’ll save it for later.”
Sebastian smiled unpleasantly.
Nancy hadn’t paid any attention to the exchange whatsoever.
Fine.
Binyelum looked toward the port terminal.
“Let’s see.” 
They flicked Mambele’s headlights on, then quickly off, then on again, five times in succession.
They received no response.
They repeated the signal.
Again no response.
Again they repeated the signal.
After the fifth repetition, one of the pairs of headlights out on the port terminal flicked off and on one single time.
Binyelum nodded.
“Let’s go make a scene.”
Binyelum kept the headlights beaming and stepped gently on the accelerator. Mambele trundled forward, lurching unevenly over the railway tracks and across a weedy field of gravel, headlights catching against an orchard of riveted steel. Angled beams ascended into low-hanging shadow.
Jhansi swallowed.
She looked around.
This definitely didn’t feel less liminal than the tunnel.
A chill ran down Jhansi’s spine.
She turned to look out the rear windshield.
Nothing.
Fuck.
At least in the tunnel, a threat could only come from one direction.
Jhansi looked forward again.
Something moved in the darkness.
The suggestion of insect legs scurried up a sloping grain elevator.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jhansi said, “Guys–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“I know.”
They paused.
“Don't worry.”
They gestured at the Final Hand and the sundered corpse of the IDON.
“I don’t think it’s gonna bother us.”
Hm.
Jhansi swallowed.
The shape had disappeared from the elevator.
Binyelum pulled Mambele closer to the terminal.
Two bulky human silhouettes stepped into the sedan’s headlights.
The taller silhouette grabbed the other’s bulging wrist with a similarly bulging hand, a gesture that looked fluid and rehearsed. The shorter silhouette tugged lightly against their compatriot. Their limbs seemed to cinch together, apparently locked in place by some mechanism.
Both silhouettes raised their free hands and gestured for Binyelum to stop.
Binyelum braked, put Mambele in park, and gently opened the driver's side door.
“We cool?”
The shorter silhouette spoke.
“How many?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Six, including me.”
Shortstop said nothing.
A different, higher pitched voice called from somewhere out of sight.
“Checks out!”
Shortstop nodded.
“You.”
They gestured at Binyelum.
“All the way out. Slow, with your hands up.”
Binyelum waved a hand.
“Yeah yeah.”
They looked into the rearview mirror.
“Stay put.”
They raised both hands and stood from Mambele.
Shortstop nodded.
“What do you want?”
Binyelum said, “I want to know why you're here.”
Shortstop blinked.
They turned and pointed to the partially illuminated corpse.
 “There's a big fuckoff monster.”
Binyelum nodded.
“I know.”
The barest smile touched their lips.
“That thing chased us here from Bridgemall.”
Shortstop blinked again.
They said nothing.
They looked at Tallboy, then back at Binyelum.
“The doctor mentioned Bridgemall.”
Binyelum nodded again.
“Yep.”
Shortstop looked again between Tallboy and Binyelum.
“Bullshit.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Suit yourself.”
They shrugged.
“Eitehr way, you guys didn't chase that thing down here. It just kinda stumbled into your midst. Bad luck. But more importantly, why were you here in the first place?”
Shortstop’s tone changed.
“Fuck off.”
Binyelum shrugged again.
“Suit yourself.”
Shortstop didn’t reply.
Binyelum said, “Am I free to go?”
Shortstop scoffed.
“I said fuck off.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Got it.”
They gave a thumbs-up with both their raised hands.
Oren looked at the other Asterlings and shrugged.
“Worst that happens is they tell us to fuck off.”
Binyelum ducked back into Mambele, grabbed the door, made as if to close it, then leaned their head back out into the night.
“I know something about those pylons.”
Shortstop growled.
“Yeah. The thing shot some kind of invisible energy beam or whatever.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yeah.”
They paused for a single instant.
“That’s not all it does.”
Shortstop paused.
They exchanged a look with Tallboy.
Binyelum moved to pull the door closed.
Shortstop groaned.
“Wait.”
Binyelum smirked.
They leaned out once more.
Shortstop huffed.
“That thing really chased you here all the way from Bridgemall?”
Binyelum grinned.
“Yep.”
Shortstop hesitated.
They shook their head.
Their tone didn’t soften.
“How the fuck did you get away?”
Binyelum formed the index finger and thumb of their left hand into a gun and pointed it at the two silhouetted teenagers.
“Adaptability.”
Shortstop rolled their eyes.
“Fuck off.”
They looked at Tallboy, then back to Binyelum.
“Fine. Follow us.”
Bineylum gestured toward the rest of the Asterlings.
“Them too.”
Shortstop shook their head.
“No way. Just you.”
Binyelum smiled warmly.
“Not gonna leave mine behind.”
Shortstop glanced at Tallboy.
They shook their head.
And sighed.
“Fine.”
They added, “Leave the car here.”
Binyelum gave another thumbs-up.
They looked over their shoulder.
“Astrobots, roll out.”
Oren said, “Heinous.”
Velocity said, “Yeah, that was really bad.”
Sebastian said, “I have to be seen with you in public?”
Nancy sighed through her nose.
Binyelum rolled their eyes playfully.
Shortstop said, “Leave your swords and masks.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Roger dodger, ranger danger.”
Shortstop scoffed.
Binyelum nodded at the Asterlings, then popped the trunk.
Velocity exchanged an esoteric look with Binyelum, received no reply, and shrugged.
Everyone filed out of Mambele.
A breeze welcomed Jhansi onto the asphalt. Goosebumps prickled her skin. Her nose filled with the smell of the bay. The skyward sprawling cloak pressed down onto her shoulders. All her senses flared. She stretched. Her elbows popped. She stepped back a pace and her flats caught against a crack in the concrete.
All of it felt so vital.
Something like an astronaut’s homecoming?
The Asterlings divested of their arms and Binyelum closed up Mambele.
Tallboy made a noise as Nancy stepped into view.
Shortstop nodded over their shoulder toward the hemisphere of headlights.
“Start walking. We’ll follow behind. Act stupid and get dead.”
Binyelum nodded.
“A lesson in causality.”
Shortstop rolled their eyes.
Binyelum gestured the Asterlings forward.
Jhansi opened and closed her fists as she walked.
Something about her body felt so strange.
What, exactly?
Like something had gone missing.
Her fire extinguisher.
She felt naked without it.
Defenseless.
Jhansi looked over her shoulder.
Wait.
Wait!
What the fuck?!
Jhansi’s heart rocketed into her throat.
Endlings!
Fuck!
Had they stumbled into a trap?
Fuck!
Jhansi whirled on Binyelum.
“Endli–”
Headlight radiance illuminated the two silhouettes.
Oh.
Sonofabitch.
Jhansi shut her mouth.
Fuck.
Shortstop and Tallboy wore burnt black armor built from endling bones.
The ensemble looked unreal–helmets fashioned from skulls, jaws opened wide, shining teeth and tusks obscuring the wearer’s face; breastplates fashioned from rib cages, the bones broken and reassembled, fused together into an impenetrable barrier; greaves fashioned from femurs, tibias, and fibulas, with jointed, pistoning bones connected to armored jump boots; gauntlets fashioned from phalanxes and claws, razored edges made retractable with some mechanism, extending past the wearer’s fingers when engaged.
Ah.
Jhansi understood what Shortstop had done by tugging against Tallboy’s grab.
The retractable claws served as more than weapons. A receiver built into each gauntlet could lock the claws from another firmly in place. Tallboy didn’t even have room to wiggle their fingers away from Shortstop’s wrist. Only dismemberment could sever their ability to share gifts.
Huh.
Could those receivers lock in place the claws of a living endling?
Probably.
Fascinating.
And both soldiers carried even more weapons besides.
Shortstop and Tallboy both wore a special one’s sword at their side–a crowbar and a pipe wrench, respectively–and a massive serrated slab of bone cinched against their back.
Not an endling bone.
An alterling bone?
Probably.
Fucking fascinating.
Both bonesaws had a slightly different shape, but neither had a handle that Jhansi could see.
Maybe they had some kind of receiver mechanism, like the gauntlets?
Jhansi blinked.
How long had she stood staring?
Shortstop huffed.
“Excuse me?”
Binyelum shot Jhansi a look.
Fuck.
What did that mean?
Jhansi panicked.
“Your armor.”
Binyelum rolled their eyes.
Static flickered to life throughout Jhansi’s interior space.
Shortstop said, “What about it?”
Jhansi gestured.
“It’s–”
Fuck.
What should she say?
“–bones.”
Fuck!
Shortstop snorted.
Tallboy turned to Binyelum.
“Your girl a fucking windshield painter or something?”
What?
Windshield painter?
What the fuck did that mean?
Jhansi said, “What?”
Binyelum gave her another agonized look.
They turned to Tallboy.
“What do you think?”
Tallboy snickered.
Shortstop said, “You’re carrying a windshield painter and you managed to get away from that?”
They gestured forward.
Jhansi followed their motion.
The scene around the fallen IDON came into focus.
A ratioed mix of Acura Integras–most of them late second generation models–and Rounded Line Chevrolet Blazers circled the corpse. The entire fleet wore the same shade of true red paint, clearly detailed at the beginning of the night but now flecked with grime and splattered with orange blood. Every license plate identifier began with an FH, followed by a zero-padded number: FH00568 on one of the Acuras, and FH00200 on one of the Blazers.
Figures patrolled the perimeter in pairs, while others worked to disassemble the IDON. The alterling’s body diminished moment by moment beneath the methodical coordination. Two dozen bonesaws chewed slowly but inexorably through the monster’s armored flesh. Intermittent percussions resounded, each signaling another piece of leg or body falling to the concrete. Organized piles of gore leaned against a stack of shipping containers. A solitary pair of soldiers supervised the work from atop the stack. Another solitary pair struggled to pull free one of the IDON’s pylons.
A new voice called from behind.
“What’s this?”
Jhansi whipped around.
Another tall soldier walked out from the cloak, with two more soldiers locked together flanking behind.
Polished rebar glittered in the free hand of both escorts.
The leader wore what looked like the shorter side of a heavy metal bedframe slung across their hip.
Damn.
Shortstop and Tallboy stiffened and unlocked their gauntlets. Both soldiers slammed their right hand over their heart and reached gently forward with their left hand, palm held upward. A salute.
Both soliders spoke in unison.
“Captain.”
Captain nodded.
Shortstop and Tallboy relaxed.
Captain repeated themselves.
“What’s this?”
They nodded at the Asterlings.
Shortstop said, “Looks like they’re the reason–”
They pointed toward the corpse of the IDON.
“–that thing showed up.”
Captain blinked.
They said nothing.
They looked toward the carnage.
Jhansi followed their gaze.
Further details coalesced.
She saw a lot of red blood.
More than she had originally assumed.
Captain looked up toward the moon, then toward the Asterlings, then back to the Shortstop.
“What then?”
Their voice hardened.
“They led it here?”
Shortstop shook their head.
“No sir.”
They paused.
“Not technically.”
They glanced at Binyelum.
“It chased them here.”
Captain huffed.
“Cardner, that’s the same thing.”
Cardner shook his head.
“I don’t like it either, sir.”
He glanced at Jhansi.
“But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Huh?
Wait.
Why glance at Jhansi?
Captain cocked their head.
“That’s generous amnesty.”
They glanced around at the Asterlings.
“I’m not so sure they’ve actually earned it.”
Cardner nodded.
“Yes, sir.”
Captain turned to the Asterlings.
“You led that thing here?”
Binyelum nodded, then shrugged.
“More or less.”
They gestured behind them.
“We led it to the Strawberri Eight.”
Captain followed Binyelum’s gesture and looked toward the city.
“The Strawberri Eight.”
They paused.
“Why?”
Binyelum shrugged again.
“We wanted to get away from it.”
Captain stepped closer to Binyelum.
“You think you’re smart?”
Binyelum smiled ruefully.
“Bad habit.”
Captain cocked their head.
“You’re luck’s gonna run out before you know it.”
Binyelum grinned.
“That’s when it gets really interesting.”
Captain shook their head.
They took a step back.
“How did you get away?”
Binyelum furrowed their brows.
“I told you. We escaped into the Strawberri Eight.”
Captain crossed their arms.
“And it didn’t just crush you inside the building?”
Binyelum made a face.
“Am I in trouble or something?”
Captain opened their arms wide.
“That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“I’m not obligated to reveal our gifts to you.”
Captain snorted.
“You escaped using your gift?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Isn’t that what everyone does?”
Captain stared at Binyelum.
“How did you end up down here?”
They gestured around at the terminal.
Binyelum huffed.
“It’s embarrassing to say it to a soldier.”
Captain raised their eyebrows.
Binyelum thrust their hands into their pockets.
“We followed it.”
Captain blinked.
They shook their head.
“Pejudo.”
They briefly held their head in both hands.
“Hang on.”
They glared.
“You’re telling me you managed to escape that thing–”
They gestured toward the corpse of the IDON.
“–and then you turned around and followed it?”
They shook their head.
“Just how rancid is your brain?”
They shook their head again.
“Whatever. Just explain why the fuck you followed it.”
Binyelum scratched the back of their head.
They chuckled.
“Uh, because …”
They paused.
“… we wanted to see if we could get the doctor to mention us again.”
Captain froze.
They stared at Binyelum.
Jhansi heard their teeth click together.
Both Captian’s hands curled into shuddering fists.
“You fucking–”
They exhaled.
“–dumbasses.”
Binyelum opened their mouth.
Captain interrupted.
“You just couldn’t fucking stop yourselves, could you? Had to fucking come and show your faces here, grab one more shot of the butchery for your fucking bait reel.”
They straightened.
“Dumbass fucking clout chasers.”
They stepped forward and pushed a clawed finger against Binyelum’s chest.
“What were you expecting? A warm welcome?”
Binyelum opened their mouth.
Captain interrupted.
“Do you have any idea how many of my fri–”
They paused.
“–how many of my men I had to watch die because of your pathetic fucking ego stunt?”
They jabbed their finger into Binyelum’s chest.
A dark stain of blood soaked through Binyelum’s jacket. 
“Well?”
Binyelum raised both hands.
Their expression softened entirely.
They spoke with direct sincerity.
“I am so fucking sorry.”
Captain snorted.
“You don’t–”
They cut themselves off.
They looked around at Cardner and Tallboy and both stoic escorts.
They huffed and shook their head.
“Whatever.”
They turned to Cardner.
“Cardner, why the hell did you bring them over here?”
Cardner nodded.
“Sir. It seemed right to let you vet the authenticity of their story. I’d pull off my own arms if they were dangerous and I sent them away.”
He paused, then pointed at Binyelum.
“And that one said they knew something useful about the pylons on that monster’s body.”
Captain nodded.
They looked at Binyelum, then toward the corpse of the IDON.
“Cardner, you have good instincts.”
They paused.
“But I don’t give a hero’s squirty shit what they have to say.”
Wow.
Fucking.
Gross.
Nobody spoke.
The methodical sound of dismemberment continued in the background.
Cardner said, “Understood, sir.”
He paused.
“What should we do with them?”
Captain shook their head.
“I don’t fucking care.”
They gestured.
“Tie ‘em to a pylon and throw ‘em into the bay.”
Cardner didn’t move.
“Captain?”
Captain shook their head again.
“No.”
They held their head with both hands.
“Don’t throw them into the bay.”
They let their hands fall.
“I really don’t care.”
They gestured.
“Introduce them to the others. They’re a good fit.”
Cardner nodded.
Captain muttered, “Fucking jergers.”
Wait.
Hold the fuck on.
Even if Jhansi didn’t know what that word meant–
Jhansi said, “Hey!”
Everyone turned to look at her.
Binyelum groaned quietly.
Well.
Fuck them.
Jhansi stepped forward.
She gestured toward the mess.
“We fucking got away from that thing.”
Captain stared at her.
Jhansi shook her head.
She stared back.
“Six fucking losers.”
Captain continued to stare.
Jhansi stared back.
“Better job than your power armor army thugs.”
Captain continued to stare.
Jhansi stared back.
Captain laughed.
Once.
A couple more times.
They held their head in both hands.
“I can’t believe this.”
They turned to Jhansi.
“Are you fucking serious, broodwife?”
What?!
Jhansi blinked.
“What the fuck did you just call me?”
Captain stepped toward her.
They fucking loomed.
Light glanced across a single eye shining beneath their helmet.
“Have you ever lost anything?”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Captain shook their head.
Their single eye never wavered.
They took another step closer.
“How long do you think they’re going to last, realistically?”
What?
Jhansi blinked again.
“What?”
A cruel smile spread bright behind the tusks of Captian’s helmet.
They lowered their voice.
“Your friends.”
They nodded toward the Asterlings.
“How long do you think they’re going to last?”
Last?
Like how?
Oh.
Fuck.
What?
Haha.
No.
That kind of thing didn’t happen to the protagonist’s party.
Jhansi shook her head.
“My friends are going to be fine.”
Captain’s single eye blinked.
And searched Jhansi’s face.
Jhansi stared back.
The eye roved between both of hers, then down across her mouth, then back up to her eyes.
Captain tilted their head.
“You really fucking think that, don’t you?”
Jhansi nodded.
“Yes.”
Captain laughed.
They took a step back from Jhansi and guffawed into the sky.
The sound rolled across the terminal.
It hit Jhansi right in the stomach.
Captain’s voice strained.
Each percussion arrived with jagged edges.
Haunting and violent barks.
The laughter faded by degrees.
Fuck.
Captain brought a hand to their forehead.
“You poor fucking girl.”
They looked down at Jhansi.
“I don’t believe this.”
They looked at Cardner and Tallboy.
“Get these morons out of my sight.”
Both Cardner and Tallboy saluted.
“Yes, sir.”
Captain turned to Jhansi.
“I hope you appreciate your friends.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“Of course I do.”
Captain shrugged.
“Whatever.”
They turned and headed away toward the commotion, flanked by their escort.
Cardner, Tallboy, and the Asterlings watched them walk away.
Binyelum shrugged.
“I really am sorry.”
Cardner said, “Shut the fuck up.”
They gestured over their shoulder.
“Get moving.”
Binyelum said, “Where to?”
Tallboy said, “The Idea of a Place We’ve Never Been.”
Binyelum’s face lit up.
“That’s why you’re here!”
Tallboy huffed.
“Whatever.”
They shoved Binyelum’s shoulders.
“Get moving.”
Cardner gestured.
“Yeah. Move it.”
Binyelum made a face at Tallboy, then nodded at the Asterlings.
“Law’s been laid, friends.”
Binyelum’s gaze landed on Jhansi and lingered for a second.
She didn’t understand their expression at all.
The Asterlings moved and Jhansi followed, away from the circle of headlights and back into the oppressive dark.
Binyelum said, “You’re not gonna watch my Nissan, are you?”
Cardner laughed.
Binyelum nodded.
“Figures.”
Tallboy said, “You can park it down with the others.”
Binyelum nodded again.
Cardner gestured lazily out into the night.
“Alright.”
They gestured vaguely in front of them.
“Off the concrete here–”
They gestured vaguely into the distance.
“–you’ll head toward a grain elevator over there. Underneath it you’ll–”
Wait!
Jhansi interrupted.
“There’s an alterling out there!”
Cardner shrugged.
“And?”
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
Binyelum gave her another indecipherable expression and put a hand on her shoulder.
Fuck.
Heat rose in her cheeks.
Could anybody tell?
Binyelum said, “It’ll be fine.”
Tallboy said, “No wonder she pissed herself.”
Ugh!
Jhansi shouted, “Shut up!”
Tallboy laughed.
Cardner said, “Anyway. Underneath the grain elevator, the ground will start sloping toward the water. Turn left and it should be pretty obvious from there.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Thanks.”
Cardner shrugged.
“Following orders.”
Binyelum nodded again.
“Roger dodger.”
They paused.
 “I hope you make it to the end.”
Cardner shook their head.
“Whatever.”
They turned to Tallboy, exchanged a look, and both headed back toward the headlights.
Binyelum watched them go.
Well.
That had really kinda sucked.
Jhansi said, “Okay, what’s that word mean?”
Oren looked at her.
“Jerger?”
Jhansi nodded.
“Yeah. That one.”
Oren rolled his eyes.
“Jerkoff greasers.”
Excuse me?
Heat rose in Jhansi’s cheeks.
A chuckle forced its way past her lips in spite of her embarrassment.
What a stupid phrase.
Jhansi shook her head.
“What?”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
He shrugged.
“It’s like, I dunno, you’re a disposable but briefly useful distraction.”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
“Okay.”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
Jhansi said, “Then what’s a windshield painter?”
Binyelum laughed.
Sebastian said, “It means you’re birdshit.”
Jhansi made a face.
“You’re birdshit.”
Sebastian snorted.
Oren said, “It means you died on your very first night as an endling.”	
What?
Jhansi frowned.
“What?”
Binyelum wiggled their index finger at her.
“It means you’re a worm.”
Wait what?
Jhansi scowled.
“Fuck off.”
She glared around at no one.
“That’s bullshit anyway. I was never an endling.”
Binyelum paused.
They stared at Jhansi.
They looked around at the Asterlings.
Sebastian held Binyelum’s gaze the longest.
Binyelum looked back at Jhansi.
They shook their head.
“Sure thing, wormling.”
What?
What the hell did that mean?
Jhansi glowered.
“No. No way. Absolutely not.”
Binyelum shrugged.
“You’re the one who asked for a new title. I’m just trying to work with you.”
Static lashed throughout Jhansi’s interior space.
“You’re being a dick!”
Binyelum’s mouth fell into a hard line.
They exhaled slowly.
“Fine, whatever.”
Everyone stared at Binyelum.
Then Jhansi.
Static stabbed straight through Jhansi from the direction of every eye.
Fuck.
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“Why’d you let them think I painted a windshield?”
She glared at Binyelum.
“Why do you lie about fucking everything?”
A sweeping breeze rushed across Jhansi’s skin.
Binyelum blinked.
They stared at Jhansi with an expression she had never seen them use before.
Sebastian glanced around.
“Pej, Jhansi, give us an encore, shout it loud enough for those all the way in the back!”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
Binyelum crossed their arms.
“I don’t lie about everything.”
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum held her gaze.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, power is a scarce resource. When I get it, I like to keep it. Knowledge is one of the few things we can actually access, I’m not giving it away if I don’t have to.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
No.
That shouldn’t matter.
Jhansi shook her head.
“But that doesn’t matter.”
She gestured around.
“We’re doing something special here.”
Velocity snorted.
Sebastian sighed.
Oren stepped forward.
Bineylum spoke first.
“We can’t do something special if we don’t survive.”
Well.
Yeah.
Right.
Binyelum’s job.
Jhansi nodded.
“Right, right. I get it.”
Sebastian laughed.
Ugh!
Jhansi whirled around.
“Asshole!”
Binyelum snapped their fingers.
“Come on, we’re done with this.”
They gestured.
“We have something special to do.”
Sebastian groaned.
Oren said, “You still haven’t told us where we’re going next.”
Binyelum paused.
They looked out toward the water.
“Let’s join the party first.”
Sebastian blinked.
“After all that–”
He gestured around at the night.
“–you’re gonna leave Kiran hanging?”
Binyelum’s features shifted into an expression Jhansi didn’t understand.
“I think we could use the break.”
Oren gave Bineylum a long look.
Velocity shrugged.
“Fine by me.”
Sebastian raised both eyebrows.
“I’m not going to argue.”
Nancy’s mouth flattened into a line.
Binyelum said, “Let’s go.”
The Asterlings ducked back into Mambele.
Jhansi again ended up on Oren’s lap.
She reached to fold her skirt and blinked.
Her deck of playing cards stared phantasmically up at her from the floor.
She grabbed it, and found the black Sharpie lying in the darkness beside it.
Waitaminute.
Not red?
Binyelum guided Mambele off the concrete and across the crunching gravel.
They weaved slowly through the forest of slanted steel with the dark expanse of the bay sliding past on the passenger’s side.
Oren leaned forward.
“Lucky break.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Broken and reborn anew.”
Oren cocked his head.
“What?”
He shook his head and laughed.
“I meant us.”
Binyelum looked at Oren in the rearview mirror.
“You think?”
Oren gestured out the rear windshield.
“They took care of that thing.”
He waved a hand.
“Grateful to not have it prowling around with a fucking chip on its shoulder.”
Velocity said, “Boulder shoulder.”
They paused.
“Because it’s an island.”
Sebastian deadpanned, “Wow.”
Binyelum said to Oren, “I dunno. Maybe it would’ve taken care of some other future problem for us.”
Oren groaned in his throat.
He leaned back against the seat.
“Whatever.”
The unseen weight of the grain elevator unfurled above them.
It seemed to stretch in every direction.
Jhansi swallowed.
Somewhere up there an alterling crept around, four or six or eight disgusting insect legs clinging to old metal as the monster leaned to watch them, Mambele reflected a thousand times in its bulging compound eyes.
A glistening barb punctured straight through Mambele’s roof and plunged into Oren’s skull, crushing his forehead, forcing both his eyeballs from their sockets, forcing a slick gush of blood from his open mouth.
What?!
Jhansi opened her mouth to scream.
Oren said, “I just feel bad.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi swallowed again.
A shiver ran through her entire body.
The dark shape laughed.
Fuck.
She hated that.
Oren added, “I want it to have been worth it.”
Binyelum looked in the rearview mirror and raised their eyebrows.
“Worth it?”
Oren shrugged.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum cocked their h
He gestured out the rear windshield.
“That. Them.”
He paused.
“The Final Hand guys.”
Binyelum nodded slowly.
“Ah.”
They looked ahead.
“You would.”
Oren lifted his arms and let them fall.
“I just–”
He closed his mouth.
Binyelum said, “Everyone on the ground floor has it rough. You know that.”
Oren gestured.
“Because there’s not already enough shit to wade through down here.”
He sighed.
“Just sucks to give it all up for someone else.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Everyone makes their own choices.”
Oren stared at Binyelum.
“I’m beginning to wonder about that.”
Binyelum glanced in the rearview mirror, but stayed silent.
The field of riveted supports cleared. The press of the grain elevator lifted. Mambele’s headlights dipped over a sudden dropoff marked by a short concrete barricade. Binyelum turned the wheel to the left. The headlights found solid ground again, the land sloping away down toward a large semicircle of beaming headlights.
Ugh.
What now?
Jhansi crossed her arms and looked closer.
Nebulites flickered in the center of the scene.
Wait, no.
Not nebulites.
The bright colors strobed and swirled and danced, blurring from hue to hue in patterns that left sharp afterimages burning in their wake. 
The thump of uptempo music echoed up the slope.
Oh.
Fuck.
Binyelum had said something about a party.
Jhansi pointed.
“What’s this?”
Velocity grinned.
“The Idea of a Place We’ve Never Been.”
Jhansi blinked.
“That explains so much.”
Binyelum said, “Party kids.”
Jhansi’s mouth fell into a flat line.
“Again, so helpful.”
Velocity grinned.
“Sex, drugs, rock and roll.”
They held up a pair of finger guns.
“No chaperones here.”
Hold on.
Jhansi made a face.
“That’s all they do?”
Velocity blinked.
“Not enough to keep you busy? Princess is such a viceling.”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“I mean, why would anyone want to do any of that stuff?”
Binyelum smirked.
“Why indeed, prudeling?”
For fuck’s sake!
Jhansi huffed.
“I mean tonight. Why would anyone waste their time doing any of that shit tonight, here, in the motherfucking netherlume shift.”
Binyelum’s smirk widened.
“Why’s this different from any other night?”
Come on!
Jhansi waggled her hands.
“They’re going to fucking die!”
Binyelum blinked.
“Don’t you want to have sex, do drugs, and be transformed by rock and roll before you die?”
What?
Hah.
No.
Absolutely fucking not.
The dark shape leered.
{“Be a better liar.”}
Jhansi screamed, {“Shut the fuck up!”}
Ugh.
Fuck.
Whatever.
It didn’t matter.
Jhansi didn’t belong in that world.
“I–”
She crossed her arms.
Velocity laughed.
Sebastian said, “Wee woo, wee woo, watch out for the purity police.”
Jhansi shot Sebastian a look.
“It’s not like that! I just–”
She just what?
Ugh.
Jhansi gestured.
“I just think people should have different priorities.”
Binyelum chuckled and shrugged.
“Your prerogative, prudeling.”
Well yeah.
But.
Jhansi blinked.
“Wait.”
She narrowed her eyes.
“You’re not–”
She looked around at everyone else.
“Is that why we’re here?”
A chilling vice gripped her stomach.
“You’re all gonna do that stuff?”
All the other Asterlings shrugged in unison.
Even Nancy, who hadn’t turned around once during the conversation.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Motherfucker!
Jhansi’s face burned.
Binyelum said, “You’re welcome to join.”
Hah.
Right.
And fucking humiliate herself in front of everyone?
Static hummed to life throughout Jhansi’s interior space
Fuck.
No.
Absolutely fucking not.
Slow waves of voltage roiled and crashed.
Jhansi said nothing.
Fuck.
Mambele’s tires pushed gently into rough sand.
The music grew louder.
The hemisphere of cars came into better focus.
A beige 1981 Toyota Cressida.
A light blue 1989 Honda Civic.
A lime green 1993 Isuzu Amigo.
And on.
And on.
Jhansi lost count after the twenty-fifth.
Ugh.
Five more red Integras and another red Blazer idled within the menagerie.
Huh.
A crowd swayed at the center of the scene.
More than a hundred bodies bucked against each other.
A heaving organism fixed in place by beaming headlight radiance.
Binyelum rolled down the driver’s side window and leaned out into the night.
The sound of voices swelled on the wind.
Two pairs of special ones stood with clasped hands and bobbing heads at the heart of the hemisphere. A blinding white light strobed from the body of a long-haired teenager in the first pair. Their skin flickered with patterns that emphasized the rhythm of the music. Spiraling colored lights streamed from the eyes and mouth of the tattooed teenager in the second pair. The hues shifted with the tone of the music, bright reds flaring against shimmering leads, dark greens and blues precipitating thunderous drops.
Another pair of special ones stood with clasped hands atop a raised dais near the back of the hemisphere. The taller of the pair held their mouth shockingly wide. Music blared from the orifice. The teenager swayed with an elegant irregularity, as though somehow hearing a completely different rhythm than the one emanating from their mouth. The shorter of the pair appeared to lead. They squeezed their partner’s hand hard as they jerked and flailed in perfect synchronicity with the music. As Jhansi watched, she realized that Tiny Dancer probably created the music with their movements.
Wow.
Holy fuck.
Jhansi pointed.
“Those are gifts?”
Binyelum grinned.
“Yep.”
What the fuck?
Jhansi looked around at everyone.
“That’s fucking useless!”
Velocity said, “Helps you have a good time.”
Sebastian said, “How useful is your gift, princess?”
Static stabbed straight through Jhansi’s chest.
Jhansi scowled.
“Fuck off.”
Binyelum parked Mambele several car lengths outside the hemisphere, but kept her headlights pointed toward the party.
They left the key in the ignition.
“Let’s go make a scene.”
They opened the door and stepped onto the sand.
Velocity, Sebastian, and Nancy all followed.
Jhansi stayed put.
Oren blinked at her.
“I do kind of want to go.”
Oh.
Right.
Jhansi blinked at him.
“Sorry.”
She climbed out into the night.
Oren followed right behind.
