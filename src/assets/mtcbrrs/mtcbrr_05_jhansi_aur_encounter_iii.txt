Jhansi Aur - Encounter III
[1340 MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ 6.94% Luminosity

A group of Swedish settlers reached the eastern coastline of the North American continent partway through the seventeenth century, sighting land already inhabited by the Lenape people. The settlers sailed south before disembarking, eventually stumbling across a recessed bay with a long, rocky island protecting its wide mouth. They passed into the bay, following the coastline until they reached the furthest inland point, where the water flowed into a river reaching deeper into the continent.
The settlers weighed anchor and established a colony.
That colony grew–over several centuries of storied violence–into the port city of St. Alëmskaan’machi, the largest metropolitan area in the state of Delaware, and one of the preeminent hubs of American and international economics.
The city’s expansive port flourished along the southern edge of Goldbar Bay, opposite the industrial district to the north. Shipping traffic entered the bay south of the barrier island, the Portvaktens Palats, and exited via the northern passage. The metal spires of the downtown district rose in a crowd near the Clearway River estuary. The rest of the city sprawled inland from there, divided by the river, privileged neighborhoods stretching northward and working class neighborhoods to the south. A series of eclectic, beloved bridges connected both halves of the city, most designed for automotive traffic, a small handful exclusively for foot traffic.
The three-story, one-hundred and fifty meter structure of the Bridgemall Commercial Park spanned the Clearway River about two miles inland, held above the water by thick tied-arch beams. The space housed two-hundred trendy stores; an indoor ice skating rink near the south entrance; a multi-story climbing wall near the north entrance; and a central food court installed across all three stories. Covered bridges spaced at wide intervals connected the mezzanines on the second and third floors, a fractal mirror of the shape of the building. Large bulbous lights hung at varying lengths from the ceiling, some reaching all the way down to the first floor. Rings of fast food vending establishments encircled the central space of each floor, where concentric patterns of tables and chairs sat atop specially engineered glass panels, the view of the river below virtually unobstructed, visible from every floor. An overhead glass dome allowed sunlight to pierce through the entire building.
Jhansi clapped.
“I love Bridgemall!”
She paused.
“What’s at Bridgemall?”
Bineylum said, “We’re looking for someone.”
Right.
Oren had said something about that.
Someone with a K name?
Jhansi cocked her head.
“What’s the deal with that? How do you know they’re supposed to be with you? How come they’re not?”
Binyelum dragged their fingers across the shifter.
“I know she’s supposed to be with us because I saw her in the daydreaming.”
They paused.
“We all saw each other, that’s part of how it works.”
Great.
Another anomaly in Jhansi’s experience.
Commercial establishments and five-over-one apartments flashed past outside the window. 
Nebulites blinked overhead at uneven intervals.
Binyelum shrugged.
“I don’t know why she wasn’t close by when the netherlume shift started.”
They paused.
“It worries me.”
And the Asterlings found Jhansi instead.
Did Binyelum include that in their list of worries?
Jhansi frowned.
“This girl’s at Bridgemall?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No.”
They gestured.
“It looks like there’s probably an endling at Bridgemall who knows where she is.”
Jhansi blinked.
“You learned that from the memory card you crushed?”
Binyelum nodded.
“All the endlings back there had the information.”
Velocity bucked their legs, bouncing Jhansi.
“Didn’t you break a memory card too?”
Jhansi frowned.
She looked across at Oren, searching his face for support.
“Well. Yeah. I just–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“She has a hard time with memories.”
Velocity huffed.
“Figures.”
Sebastian raised his eyebrows.
“And you’re sure she’s not gonna fuck this up?”
Jhansi said, “Hey!”
Binyelum shrugged.
“I’ll let you spank me when I’m wrong.”
Sebastian pressed together his lips and bugged out his eyes.
Thorns of static extruded slowly from the perimeter of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi smashed them back down.
It hurt, but it would hurt a lot more to lose control on Velocity’s lap.
Okay.
Maybe she could refocus the conversation.
“What’s it like? Seeing a memory like that?”
Sebastian leered theatrically, raised both hands like claws.
“I watched through an endling’s eyes as it ate a teenager’s head.”
Oh.
Wait.
Hang on.
Bad idea.
Jhansi raised her hands.
“Okay, point taken.”
Sebastian’s leer widened.
His eyes went slightly crossed.
He spoke breathlessly.
“I felt it. All of it.”
He looked at his hands.
“Not just the way their body twitched and squirmed in my grip, but–”
He looked straight at Jhansi.
“–the way it felt inside.”
The dark shape writhed outward from the shadows at the edge of Jhansi's interior space.
Fuck.
That thing again.
Sebastian’s leer turned to a grin.
“I loved it. It felt so good, seeing them so helpless. And pathetic. And amusing.”
Fuck.
The dark shape said, {“Amusing.”}
Fuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I get it!”
Sebastian continued.
“Their squealing resonated in my mouth. I could taste their tears and snot on my tongue. I salivated. I chewed. I could tell I had been designed for it. Just a little pressure and–”
Sebastian laughed.
“–their squealing pitched up like a fucking cartoon.”
The dark shape churned and swelled.
{“Yes.”}
Sebastian shook his head.
“It was so fucking funny! I couldn’t hold back. I bit down. Their skull shattered. Brains squeezed like fucking easy cheese into my mouth. Their whole life spurted into my throat and I swallowed it down.”
What.
The.
Fuck.
The dark shape panted.
Jhansi's hands shook.
“That’s–”
Sebastian kept going.
“They pissed and shit them–”
Nancy leaned forward from the front seat.
Sebastian shut up, somehow managing to furrow his brows and widen his eyes.
Nancy reached an index finger toward Sebastian's mouth.
Sebastian backed away slightly.
Nancy persisted.
She held her index finger an inch from Sebastian's lips.
She shook her head, pulling her features into an adorable and uncanny smile.
Sebastian blinked.
His cheeks went pink.
“Sorry.”
Nancy's expression fell back into indecipherable neutrality.
She stared at Sebastian.
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
Holy fuck.
She breathed hard, practically snorting through flared nostrils.
Blood pounded in her ears.
Her stomach felt hot and tight.
The dark shape stared at her.
She snarled at it.
{“Fuck off!”}
The dark shape shrugged.
What the hell did this mean?
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum looked at Sebastian in the rearview mirror.
“Did you get to see their gift?”
Sebastian blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum nodded.
“The special one you saw in your memory, they had a gift.”
Binyelum paused.
“Did you get to see them use it?”
Sebastian blinked again.
“Actually, yeah, I did.”
Binyelum gestured.
“What was it?”
A vacant seafood market emerged from the cloak on their right. An unlit neon fish gawped at Jhansi from above the gated glass doorway, eerily underlit by the diffuse baby blue nebulite glowing somewhere inside. Orange blood dripped down the graffiti painted across the facade of the building.
Sebastian said, “Their gift was a mobility boost. A kind of jump, I guess? It would launch someone forward and upward, at a little less than a forty-five degree angle. Pretty fast, without any kind of charge up. They’d even get a little animated motion line afterimage.”
He paused.
“I watched them throw a special one with a pipe wrench straight into an endling’s face.”
He paused again.
“The wrench smashed through the endling’s eye.”
Another pause.
“It was a killswing.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s a useful gift.”
Jhansi stared through Sebastian, trying to clear her thoughts.
Binyelum said, “Probably gonna be like that at Bridgemall.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi said, “What?”
The Asterlings had dispatched the endlings at The Rescue so easily.
But.
If they had lost.
Would it have ended like Sebastian had just described?
Jhansi’s stomach turned.
Jhansi shook her head.
“You guys took care of the endlings back there so easily.”
Sebastian frowned.
“Get out from behind your screen. It’s a very different experience.”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
Binyelum pulled Mambele into a parking lot.
Jhansi looked around.
They couldn’t have arrived at Bridgemall.
Not yet.
Jhansi hadn’t prepared herself at all.
Binyelum pulled the parking brake and left the engine running.
They opened their door, stepped into the night, and popped the seat forward.
Nancy left through her door, and Sebastian and Oren followed her.
Velocity raised their eyebrows at Jhansi.
“Come on, princess.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity gestured.
“Let’s get going.”
Jhansi blushed.
She hurried out of the car.
Velocity followed, leaving the door hanging open.
Jhansi looked around.
No nebulites.
Jhansi couldn’t see much, but still, this didn’t seem like Bridgemall.
“Where are we?”
Binyelum pointed upward.
“Washington Center.”
The Washington Center office campus consisted of an octagonal, thirteen-story tower and two adjoining rectangular buildings, one to the northwest with five stories, the other to the northeast with seven stories. Wide, glass-encased breezeways connected the bottom floors of the adjoining buildings to the central tower. The parking lot sprawled south of the campus, with a second and third level underground.
Binyelum had pointed up toward the top of the central tower.
Jhansi followed the gesture.
She couldn’t see shit.
“I can’t see shit.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Yeah.”
Oren said, “It’ll get easier to see through the cloak as the moon gets full.”
Oh wild.
Jhansi said, “Neat.”
She stopped craning her neck.
“Why are we here?”
Binyelum said, “We need to scout the route to Bridgemall.”
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
“Scout?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Do you know the safest way to Bridgemall?”
Well.
Jhansi thought for a second.
“I would head south from here until we reach one of the wider neighborhood avenues, and use one of those to get to the highway. From there–”
Sebastian interrupted.
“You’re sure there’s nothing waiting on the highway?”
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Sebastian blinked back at her.
“If I was a thirty-eight caliber alterling looking to pick off some dumb, easy special ones at the beginning of the netherlume shift, I’d lurk on the highways for sure.”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh fuck.”
Sebastian nodded.
“She begins to understand!”
Jhansi turned to Binyelum.
“How are you going to be able to scout anything in–”
She gestured around her.
“–this?”
Binyelum laughed.
“Probably not very well.”
They shrugged.
“But we have to try.”
Jhansi looked up again.
“Are there …”
She paused.
“… endlings up there?”
Sebastian adopted a cringing affectation.
“E-e-endlings?”
Jhansi shot him a look.
Binyelum shrugged.
“Won’t know ‘til we get there.”
Oh.
Jhansi looked at them.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum nodded.
“She begins to understand.”
Jhansi blinked.
She looked toward the base of the tower.
“What if it’s locked?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Oh no, we break a rule.”
What gives, asshole?
Jhansi turned and stared at him.
Binyelum said, “C’mon.”
They popped the trunk.
Everyone gathered close to retrieve their swords and masks.
Bineylum grabbed their machete, and a headband with a pair of fake fox ears fixed on top, the orange fur more vibrant a shade than Jhansi had ever seen.
Oren grabbed his chainlock and a pair of angular open back mixing headphones, stuffing the long cable down his shirt and tucking the tail of it into the pocket of his jeans.
Velocity grabbed their aluminum bat and an astronaut’s helmet, their face disappearing behind the reflective gold visor.
Sebastian grabbed his barbell and flower crown, donning the headpiece deliberately askew.
Nancy abstained from grabbing anything.
Huh.
Nancy had a whole deal, didn’t she?
Velocity flipped up the visor on their helmet in a vivid flash of makeup.
Jhansi grabbed her fire extinguisher and the canvas bag, and pulled down Mambele’s trunk.
The Asterlings turned toward the Washington Center Tower.
Jhansi hurried to catch up.
Something caught her eye.
Mambele's refresh had repaired the back of Binyelum’s jacket.
A purple rose outlined in gold crested like a rising moon, cut off halfway at the cropped hem of the jacket, encircled by text rendered in brilliant white.
TO: SOMEPLACE TO CALL YOUR OWN, FROM: WHICH TO TAKE A STAND
What an absolute bastard.
Jhansi again looked up toward the tower looming above.
Rows of empty windows stared impenetrably back, assessing her with unknowable scrutiny.
Like some predatory insect.
How inviting.
Jhansi turned to Oren.
“We didn’t scout the route between that 7-11 and The Rescue.”
Oren shrugged.
“It was early in the night. It’s …”
He paused.
“It’s hard to run into the wrong crowds when it's early.”
He paused again.
“Usually.”
Jhansi watched him.
He gestured.
“Besides, where would we have scouted from?”
Jhansi thought for a second.
“There’s that apartment building.”
Oren made a face.
“Ah, yeah.”
He nodded.
“That apartment building.”
He grinned.
“How specific.”
Jhansi stuck out her tongue.
“You know what I mean.”
Binyelum danced up the hemisphere of shallow stairs leading to the glass doors of the tower.
They paused.
“Hm.”
Everyone paused in turn.
Jhansi saw why.
One of the doors hung limp, barely connected by a single hinge.
Shattered glass lay all around.
Jhansi couldn't see the door’s push bar anywhere.
Velocity stepped forward.
“Well shit.”
Sebastian said, “Frosted and flakey.”
Binyelum toed the shards of glass.
“That's what these are.”
They looked into the dark interior of the tower lobby, then turned to face the Asterlings.
“Whoever came through was either very confident or very stupid.”
They paused.
“No care given to keeping their presence a secret, so, probably not an alterling.”
They absently scanned the empty parking lot.
“And probably not someone intent on sticking around.”
Oren said, “There's plenty of parking on the other side of the campus, and two more levels below this one.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Too much work.”
They turned back toward the smashed door.
“Nancy and Velocity, you go first.”
Oren made a face.
Binyelum noticed, and continued.
“Then Sebastian, Jhansi–”
They paused.
“Then Oren. I’ll take up the rear.”
Oren looked at Jhansi.
Wait.
What did she have to do with that?
Binyelum gestured into the building.
“There's gonna be a circular landing inside that ends with a short flight of stairs. Up those stairs, the second landing opens onto a hallway of elevators. Immediately to the right, before the elevators, there'll be a door leading to a stairwell.”
They nodded.
“We're gonna take that stairwell all the way up. Should be fine, as long as we’re slow and quiet.”
Fuck.
Jhansi swallowed.
She did not want to set foot in that building.
Her instincts screamed.
Return to Mambele.
Wait it out.
What difference would it make?
She’d probably just slow everyone down.
Nancy stepped over the shattered door and into the lobby.
How would it feel to watch everyone else disappear inside?
Fuck.
That.
Jhansi tightened her grip on her fire extinguisher, keeping close to Sebastian as he followed Velocity into the darkness.
Binyelum smiled at Jhansi as she passed.
She made a face.
The glass crunched beneath Jhansi’s flats.
The empty expanse of the lobby pulled at Jhansi.
Here goes.
Jhansi stepped over the broken door in a whirl, lifting her left foot, turning to place it inside the bent rectangle of the door, continuing the spin, placing her right foot inside with her, then repeating the motion, stepping out of the door and fully onto the landing inside the building.
She looked back.
Oren smiled as he stepped inside.
Binyelum followed.
The lobby looming around Jhansi.
The carpeted landing muffled the footsteps of the Asterlings as they moved up toward the second landing.
They passed two other flights of stairs, each on opposite sides of the landing, curving down to converge in a swampy darkness, presumably providing access to the underground parking garage.
Fuck.
Forget the highway.
That seemed as likely a place as any for endlings and alterlings to lurk.
The Asterlings crossed up onto the second landing and stepped lightly across the marble tiles. Each clack reverberated down the hallway.
The ceiling stretched further than Jhansi had expected, probably up past the second story of the tower. Not that it made much difference. Jhansi couldn’t see it. With the moon occluded, the cloak hung thicker than ever.
Jhansi squinted, searching down the hallway for anything at all for her eyes to catch on.
Elevators, staring across at each other like coffins.
Fucking great.
Nancy found the door Binyelum had mentioned.
Absent a handle.
Even better.
Nancy touched the splintered wood, shrugged to herself, and pulled.
The door swung outward.
The gloom beyond seemed even fucking worse.
Yay.
Nancy looked back.
Binyelum nodded.
Nancy disappeared through the doorway.
The rest of the Asterlings followed.
Jhansi’s visibility diminished to practically nothing.
She could barely see the back of Sebastian’s vest.
Resplendent.
The building’s architect had designed the stairwell with an octagonal shape, a mirror of the tower itself. The stairs spiraled upward around the edge of the octagon, traversing the full circumference once per floor. Tall, narrow windows, like arrowslits, opened onto the outside at regular intervals, allowing a laughably minimal amount of moonlight to filter inside.
The smack of feet on concrete echoed.
Jhansi went to mount the stairs, misjudged the distance, and stumbled awkwardly. She threw out her arms to catch herself. She caught the rail with her left hand. Her right forearm banged against the metal edge of something else.
She couldn't even see what.
“Fuck!”
Sebastian turned to glare at her.
Ugh.
He looked over Jhansi’s head, at Binyelum.
Binyelum shook their head and gestured him onward.
The Asterlings moved slowly.
Nancy held her ax ready.
Velocity kept their bat raised close behind.
Sebastian gripped his barbell.
Oren kept one of his hands free for Binyelum.
Binyelum backed up the stairs, searching the darkness below.
Jhansi counted stairs.
Six to a side of the octagon.
How many stairs would it take in total?
Five-hundred and something?
Velocity swore just as Jhansi stepped onto stair five-hundred and twenty.
“Pejudo.”
Everyone lurched to a halt.
Nancy stood one step beyond the landing of the twelfth floor, peering up past the final flight of stairs toward the ceiling of the stairwell. Velocity stood behind her on the landing. Both wore hard expressions.
Velocity said, “Welp.”
Binyelum called, “What?”
Sebastian stepped up to take a look.
His mouth flattened and his eyes went wide.
Jhansi's ears picked up a new sound.
A rhythmic, sinewy squelching, like a wet rope twisting tighter and tighter.
Then a louder snap.
Oh fuck.
Sebastian grimaced.
Nancy tightened her grip on her ax.
Velocity said, “Just come take a look.”
Binyelum pushed forward.
Fuck it.
Jhansi followed Binyelum.
Oren made a sound when Jhansi moved, but he didn't say anything.
Binyelum followed Nancy’s gaze.
“Ah.”
Jhansi craned forward.
A metal ladder stretched upward from the final landing, ending in a small platform leading into a narrow corridor. 
The white sole of a sneaker dangled in midair near the platform.
Fuck.
Jhansi took in the shape of the limp human body.
And then the unwelcome, dark topography of shapes clustered in the corner of the ceiling.
A monster.
An alterling.
The human body wore a pair of dark blue board shorts and a white button-down tee patterned with bright watermelon slices. The tee hung open, showing off the body’s tanned, hairless stomach. The body had no arms. Thick trails of blood stained both sides of the tee. Drops fell steadily from the hem, splashing into a pool on the landing.
The alterling had swallowed the body's head, and nearly half its torso.
The monster pulsed, shuddered, and pulled the body further inward.
The shape of its body had a geometric quality, something like a honeycomb.
Most of the cells held glistening mucous membranes, swollen and packed with dense patches of dark hair.
From the other cells dangled long, rough tendrils.
They curled and swayed, occasionally unfurling to stretch.
Hooked thorns grew at intervals along the length of each tendril, droplets of clear liquid beading near each point.
Two tendrils held tightly to the human body's waist, squeezing, supporting the weight.
Red blood dribbled from deep puncture wounds where the tendrils made contact with the human body's skin.
The cell at the center of the structure of the monster’s body had distended wide to receive the human body, crowding away the adjacent cells.
The membrane swelled, then clenched.
Snap.
Blood gushed from the holes in the human body.
It disappeared further into the monster.
What.
The.
Entire.
Fuck.
Binyelum said warmly, “Nice.”
Jhansi gave Binyelum a wild look.
“Excuse me?”
The words came out tight.
Binyelum looked at her.
They smiled.
Jhansi found their dark eyes unsearchable.
They turned back to face the monster.
“They’re doing it right.”
What the fuck?
Jhansi followed Binyelum’s gaze.
She stared at the feeding monster.
The dark shape said, {“Good.”}
Jhansi’s mind went blank.
The world slipped out of focus.
Someone jostled against her.
She responded automatically, backing down the stairs.
Oren said, “Solo?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Probably not. Probably picked off from a band like ours. Last one in line on the way back down.”
Velocity said, “And nobody fucking noticed?”
Bineylum nodded.
“Seems like.”
Oh fuck.
Had the monster captured the teenager alive? 
Velocity said, “Nobody noticed the fucking beehive alterling in the corner of the stairwell?”
Sebastian said, “Rough day for Pooh Bear.”
Velocity talked over him.
“Nobody noticed when they got outside and a whole fucking member of their team was gone?”
Binyelum scratched their chin.
“Maybe they just didn’t wanna risk coming back.”
Velocity shook their head.
“Nice.”
Sebastian said, “Maybe they made a sacrifice.”
Everyone turned to look at him.
He shrugged.
“To keep the alterling busy.”
Nancy raised an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth tilting upward.
Bineylum said, “No wonder you don’t trust Jhansi.”
Sebastian made a face.
Jhansi kept staring at nothing.
How had it felt?
Had the Honey Pot lifted Pooh Bear bodily before ripping off both their arms, muscles stretching, resisting, yielding, tearing with percussive snaps, their body reconfigured to fit more conveniently into the monster’s feeding apparatus?
The dark shape roiled.
The Honey Pot would have needed to paralyze Pooh Bear first, to keep them from making noise.
Oren said, “Pejudo lo anmo.”
He ran a hand through his hair.
“It’s pretty much impossible to reach that thing from the landing.”
He looked at Binyelum.
“My gift can get you or Nancy up there. It’s an awkward spot, but–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“Dunno. Don’t really like those barbs.”
Oren frowned.
Binyelum continued.
“That secretion is at least paralytic.”
They paused.
“And probably poisonous.”
Jhansi nodded absently.
Exactly.
Pooh Bear had watched, drugged and immobilized, as the Honey Pot’s awful swelling mouth had engorged to accommodate their body, the folds of its membrane filling their vision, their entire world a salivating cavern.
Binyelum said, “It’ll probably leave us alone if we don’t fuck with it.”
Velocity stared.
“Really?”
Binyelum stared back.
Velocity said, “You’re just gonna leave it there?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Why not?”
Velocity made a face.
“Because it’s fucking eating someone, Binyelum.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yeah. It’s supposed to.”
They gestured.
“That’s how this works.”
Jhansi nodded again.
Correct.
Pooh Bear’s legs had kicked out in futile protest as the Honey Pot tightened its inexorable hold, further and further, cutting off their oxygen, crushing their windpipe, sending their mind into a black reeling panic as the end descended in one pitiful climax of utter despair.
And then the monster had snapped their neck.
The dark shape gurgled.
Jhansi’s stomach turned.
No.
Not again.
Fight it.
Jhansi swallowed.
She blinked.
Back to reality.
Sebastian said, “Sure it’s not gonna take a swipe at us while we’re climbing past?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Pretty sure.”
They raised their voice.
“Because then it would die.”
They shook their head.
“It doesn’t want that.”
Velocity frowned.
“Might go for all of us at once. It’s got enough fucking tentacles.”
Binyelum raised a finger to their chin.
“Jhansi.”
Wait.
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum repeated, “Jhansi.”
Oh shit.
She should reply.
“Huh?”
Sebastian looked at her and made a face.
“Is she gonna throw up?”
Oh fuck off.
Binyelum stared at Jhansi.
“You’re gonna stand guard while the rest of us climb the ladder. If that thing makes any kind of a sudden movement, hit it with your fire extinguisher.”
Jhansi looked down at her weapon, then back at Binyelum.
She shook her head.
“I can’t reach.”
Binyelum’s eyes flashed.
“Aw. You can’t reach?”
Oh fuck.
Binyelum’s mouth lit into a grin.
“That’s okay, tryhardling.”
Oh no.
Binyelum waggled their fingers.
“Spray it.”
Fuck.
Heat filled Jhansi’s face.
Static crackled.
Jhansi squeezed the fire extinguisher.
“Oh.”
She nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum stared at her.
“Are you alright? Do you think you can handle that?”
Jhansi blinked.
“S–”
She stuttered.
“–praying?”
Binyelum laughed.
“No, tryhardling.”
They paused.
“Well, yes, if need be.”
They brought a finger to their chin.
“What I mean is, can you handle standing guard?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Right.
Could Jhansi handle watching a monster continue to devour a teenager?
The dark shape certainly thought so.
That sounded like the absolute last thing she wanted to experience right now.
She swallowed.
The sick feeling hadn’t gone away.
She felt Binyelum watching her.
What would they say if she said no?
What would all the Asterlings say?
Sebastian would feel vindicated.
Velocity might side with him.
Would Binyelum revoke her title?
The static crackled again.
Jhansi shook her head.
“It’s no problem. I can handle it.”
She pushed past everyone else.
Binyelum watched her step to the front.
They waved the others into a different formation as Jhansi started up the stairs.
Jhansi clutched her fire extinguisher reflexively against her chest.
The cold metal shocked her senses.
It felt kind of good.
She tightened her grip.
Jhansi kept her gaze fixed on the Honey Pot and her back against the wall as she ascended.
The open void of the stairwell watched her climb.
The sliver of the moon peeked down at Jhansi for just a moment from an arrowslit.
The spiral nature of the stairs had the fun effect of briefly taking Jhansi further away from the Honey Pot, skewing her perspective.
She came back around and its dimensions swelled beyond her expectations.
Jhansi stood six stairs down from the landing, staring up at a monster that filled her vision.
Well.
Of course it did.
How else could it fit an entire teenaged human being in its mouth?
Fuck.
A tendril unfurled, reaching downward.
Not all the way.
But close enough.
The tendril turned toward Jhansi.
It bent and curled.
As though beckoning her.
Fuck!
Nasty fucking freak.
Jhansi heard Sebastian's voice from behind her.
She jumped a little.
“Hey look, someone in the netherlume shift actually likes Jhansi.”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She heard Velocity slap Sebastian's arm.
Probably whispering some bullshit agreement.
Double ugh.
Jhansi looked back.
Oh shit!
All those fucking cool kids stood watching her.
Jhansi looked forward.
She inhaled.
She had to do this.
She couldn't fucking chicken out in front of them.
Jhansi looked down at her fire extinguisher.
She unhooked the hose from its housing.
A safety pin held the handle locked in place.
Jhansi removed the pin and tossed it into the open void.
She held her weapon ready and stepped forward.
Up one stair.
And again.
All the way up onto the landing.
She held the fire extinguisher forward, hand trembling on the handle, hose pointed up at the Honey Pot.
The lounging tentacle flicked.
Jhansi tensed.
The tentacle curled up.
And away.
Fuck.
Jhansi stepped forward.
Pooh Bear’s sneakers dangled above her.
A wet, sucking sound came from somewhere inside the Honey Pot’s body.
Pooh Bear’s body disappeared deeper inside.
Another stream of blood gushed forth.
Jhansi gasped.
She backed away quickly.
Double fuck.
She turned red, embarrassed and frustrated.
The monster could probably have killed her right there.
It could have grabbed her arm and pulled her off her feet and–
The dark shape seethed.
No.
Nope.
Not something she wanted to think about right now.
Jhansi looked around the landing.
Where should she stand?
Beneath the alterling?
Fucking nightmare.
The red-painted iron railing wrapped around the perimeter of the landing. 
Jhansi positioned her back against the railing, past the ladder and alongside the door onto the thirteenth floor, still close enough to catch the alterling with the fire extinguisher, but out of the way of everyone else.
“Ready.”
She glanced at the line of Asterlings.
Sebastian led the way, with Velocity behind, then Nancy, Binyelum, and Oren last.
Oren last?
Something to do with his gift.
Sebastian looked up at the Honey Pot as he crossed onto the landing.
It shuddered.
Jhansi tensed.
Sebastian backed away.
He looked at the ladder, then at his barbell.
“Fuck.”
He looked around.
The Honey Pot quivered.
Jhansi tensed again.
Sebastian stared at the Honey Pot.
He blinked.
He leaned the barbell against the wall next to the ladder.
“Velocity, hand this up to me.”
Velocity nodded.
Sebastian grabbed the ladder and pulled himself upward.
The Honey Pot barely moved.
Jhansi tensed again.
Just in case.
Velocity stepped forward.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Velocity grabbed Sebastian's barbell and handed it upward.
Sebastian leaned down to grab it.
The Honey Pot chittered.
Oh for fuck’s sake!
Jhansi tensed yet again.
“Knock it off!”
Everyone looked at her.
The Honey Pot dismissively raised and lowered a tendril.
Velocity shook their head.
They climbed the ladder, their bat banging against every other rung.
Nancy stepped up.
She stared at the Honey Pot.
It gurgled, pulling Pooh Bear’s corpse deeper inside itself.
Blood gushed.
The monster had swallowed nearly all of the teenager’s torso. 
It no longer needed to hold Pooh Bear around the waist.
Two more tendrils swung freely.
Jhansi said, “I’m serious!”
The Honey Pot didn’t respond.
Nancy squeezed her ax.
She glared at the Honey Pot, flipped her ax over in her palm, again, and again, then mounted the stairs and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Binyelum stepped up.
They grinned at Jhansi.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Binyelum gave Jhansi two thumbs up.
They mounted the stairs and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Oren stepped up.
He raised both eyebrows at the Honey Pot.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Oren draped his chainlock across his neck and back over his shoulders like an unhooked necklace, mounted the stairs, and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Jhansi blinked.
Her turn had come.
She looked up the ladder.
It seemed unreasonably tall.
Binyelum’s head appeared over the edge.
“Your services are worthy.”
They smiled.
“You may ascend.”
Jhansi looked back at the Honey Pot.
Two barbed tendrils whipped toward her!
Jhansi screamed.
The tendrils backed away.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Jhansi shook her head.
“You fucking brat!”
The Honey Pot jostled.
Moonlight winked off Binyelum’s machete up above.
Huh.
Jhansi blinked.
She stepped toward the ladder.
She stared at the Honey Pot.
She swallowed.
She mounted the ladder and climbed it as quickly as possible, her legs pistoning, her knees banging against a new rung with each thrust, her hand squeezing the textured metal bars hard enough to hurt, the fire extinguisher clattering.
Halfway up, a sensation took hold.
Jhansi saw herself.
An utterly defense creature.
Hanging in midair hundreds of feet above an open pit.
Boxed in with a hungry and lethal predator.
Her body hummed.
Her world narrowed to a pinpoint.
The platform above.
Jhansi blinked.
She panted.
She stood with her hands on her knees.
She looked over at the corner of the room.
The Honey Pot waved at her.
Oh fuck off!
Jhansi stormed after Binyelum.
She stepped out of the short corridor and into the night.
Binyelum grinned at her.
“First live one, huh?”
Jhansi glared.
“It’s fucking terrifying.”
Binyelum giggled.
“Yeah, it really is.”
They looked up.
“It really, really fucking is.”
Jeez.
A lot of respect for a fucking monster.
An alterling.
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
“You were an alterling.”
Binyelum’s eyes lit up.
“What makes you say that?”
Jhansi shrugged.
“It just makes sense?”
Binyelum nodded.
“I’m glad you feel that way.”
They grinned.
Then snorted.
“Duh.”
They playfully slapped her shoulder and stepped back.
“You think I was a fucking endling?”
Sebastian gave Binyelum a look.
Binyelum.
An alterling.
Jhansi pointed back over her shoulder at the corridor to the stairwell.
“Like that one?”
Binyelum barked a laugh.
They shook their head.
They smiled and raised an eyebrow.
“What kind of alterling do you think I was?”
Jhansi blushed.
She made a face.
Why the embarrassment?
Why hadn’t she realized this sooner?
Why hadn’t she wondered about anyone’s past?
Jhansi blinked.
“Holy shit.”
Binyelum raised an eyebrow.
“Too scary to think about?”
Jhansi snorted.
She shook her head.
“No.”
She paused.
“Well yes, but no. Just.”
She gestured.
“You all really were monsters, huh?”
Binyelum gave her a strange look.
“And you weren’t?”
Ugh!
Jhansi made a face.
“Binyelum!”
Binyelum said nothing.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I’ve told you!”
She gestured.
“Like a thousand times.”
Binyelum stared at her for longer than she would have liked.
They shrugged.
“We’ll see.”
They paused.
“Have you been working on that memory?”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“Memory?”
Binyelum made a face.
They spoke slowly.
“Yes, Jhansi. The memory you acquired back at The Rescue.”
They stared.
What?
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh! Right!”
Shit.
“That memory! Of course!”
Jhansi nodded.
She grinned.
Binyelum made a different face.
“Glad you’re up to speed.”
They frowned.
“Now. Do you remember any of it?”
Oh.
Double shit.
Jhansi actually hadn’t worked on that at all.
Her grin weakened.
“Um. Not yet?”
Binyelum’s expression darkened.
“Do what you’re good at–”
They gestured.
“–and try.”
They turned before Jhansi could reply.
Ugh.
Whatever.
Binyelum crossed the roof toward the ledge where the Asterlings had gathered, on the west side of the building.
Jhansi hurried to catch up.
Velocity gestured outward.
“Behold.”
Jhansi still couldn’t see shit.
Well.
No.
As she stared, her eyes began to pick up the distant glow of nebulites. Tiny pinpricks of color gleamed through the cloak. The longer Jhansi looked, the more she found herself able to guess at the locations of the nebulites.
A heavy emerald glow emanated from where Jhansi guessed they would find Bridgemall.
Flickers of gold danced here and there.
Headlights.
Sebastian said, “This sucks.”
Binyelum said, “First special one I ever ate–”
Wait what?
“–was a cups, whose gift allowed the receiver to see through the cloak, through the eyes of the giver.”
Sebastian frowned.
“A cups? Sounds like a pentacles thing to me.”
Velocity said, “I was thinking a swords.”
Binyelum shrugged.
“You would think so.”
What the hell did all this mean?
Jhansi gave Binyelum a look.
“Cups? Pentacles? Swords?”
Binyelum smiled.
Oren said, “Three of the four suits.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Suits?”
Oren nodded.
He held up four fingers, then pulled each of them down.
“Cups. Wands. Swords. Pentacles.”
He gestured.
“Our gifts fall under one of the four suits.”
Fascinating.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“What do the classifications mean?”
Oren smiled.
“Pentacles restore the body, or provide a boon. Swords alter the body in some way that doesn’t restore it. Wands move the body, or cause the body to move other objects. Cups affect things like thought, feeling, and memory.”
Holy shit.
Jhansi’s smile broadened.
She looked around at the Asterlings.
“What are your classifications?”
Velocity smirked.
“Princess wants to get to know us.”
What?
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“I’m just curious.”
Velocity’s smirk grew into a leer.
“About what?”
Oh.
Jhansi blinked.
She blushed.
Oren said, “I’m a five of wands.”
Huh.
Jhansi looked at him.
Fitting.
Velocity luxuriated.
“I’m a six of pentacles.”
Huh.
Jhansi looked at them.
Also fitting.
Sebastian said, “Five of pentacles.”
Huh.
It made sense according to the rules.
But.
Where did Sebastian and Velocity’s personalities overlap?
Bineylum said, “I’m a knight of swords.”
Oh for fuck’s sake.
Of fucking course.
Jhansi couldn’t stop herself from making a face.
Binyelum beamed at her.
Fuck.
More teasing.
But no.
Binyelum pointed their thumb at Nancy.
They leaned forward just a little.
“Nancy’s an ace.”
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
Nancy.
An ace?
Jhansi said, “Of swords?”
Nancy blinked slowly.
The corners of her mouth quirked slightly upward.
She stared at Jhansi.
Oh.
Fuck.
Wild.
She didn’t even have her mask.
An ace who refused to use their gift?
Jhansi said, “Is ace highest or lowest?”
Binyelum and Nancy looked at each other.
They both shrugged at the same time.
Of course.
Always the fucking esoterica.
Velocity and Sebastian had even expressed confusion over the suit of Bineylum’s first–
Waitaminute.
Jhansi said, “Hang on.”
She looked at Binyelum.
“You really killed a special one?”
Everyone looked at her.
Binyelum made a face.
“Yes?”
Oren said, “We all have.”
Jhansi blinked.
“But I thought that was like, one of the bad things.”
Binyelum pursed their lips.
“If you're a special one, yeah.”
They furrowed their brows.
“Why is this surprising?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“I don't know. Just …”
She pictured Binyelum as a gruesome shape hunched over a body, pulling it apart, devouring limbs, a thousand mouths and eyes swirling in a corporeal shadow.
All the eyes looked toward Jhansi.
What?
The dark shape roiled.
She felt hot.
What the fuck?
Jhansi looked away.
“I don't know.”
Oren put a hand on Jhansi's shoulder.
Jhansi started.
Binyelum returned their attention to the occluded sprawl of the city.
They stared.
Jhansi watched the distant nebulites flicker.
Binyelum crossed their arms.
“Quiet night.”
A massive pillar of white light erupted to the north, deep into the suburbs, miles away but still clearly visible through the cloak.
Everyone turned toward it.
The pillar of light kept stretching higher into the sky.
Particles drifted away from it at the edges.
A rushing sound, moaning white noise, surged through the city.
Oh fuck.
Jhansi’s stomach dropped.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum grinned.
“That’s more like it.”
Velocity took a step back.
“Holy shit.”
Binyelum gave Velocity a look.
“You know what that is?”
Velocity made a strange face.
“Maybe.”
The light wavered like a flame.
It broke away from the ground.
It dissipated in pieces.
Fragments drifted upward, diminishing slowly before winking out.
Oh double fuck.
Oren’s hand landed on Jhansi’s shoulder.
Binyelum exhaled.
“Well, hopefully we’ll never find out what that means.”
They nodded.
The other Asterlings looked amongst each other.
Binyelum gestured out at the city.
“Aside from that dead angel or whatever, this is nothing. It’s early, but it’s not that early. We're two hours in and nobody’s acting out?”
They shook their head.
“Weird.”
They looked south, away from the river.
They turned and looked east, back across the rooftop toward the ocean.
They looked up at the moon.
“Weird.”
Maybe it had something to do with Jhansi’s presence?
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Nope, probably shouldn’t share that thought.
Jhansi blatted.
She started over.
“I guess we can take the highway to Bridgemall after all?”
Binyelum looked at her.
“What was that?”
Oh fuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
“What was what?”
She blew a raspberry.
“Nothing.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Nothing.”
They paused, then looked back at the city.
“No highways. This–”
They gestured outward.
“–means everyone's still probably lying in wait.”
They nodded.
“We’ll drive through the neighborhoods.”
Jhansi looked northwest.
A grouping of red nebulites twinkled in the distance.
“Won’t everyone be getting restless? What if they start moving into the neighborhoods?”
Binyelum gave her an appraising look.
“Huh.”
They smiled.
“Look at you.”
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum continued.
“Good observation. That's probably what comes next. Let's get back to Mambele and head to Bridgemall before we get caught up in it.”
Oh.
Shit.
Had they just given her a compliment?
Bineylum gave the city a final look, then turned back toward the stairwell.
Back toward the Honey Pot.
Ugh.
Jhansi said, “Am I supposed to go first?”
Binyelum paused and cupped their chin.
“Yeah.”
They nodded.
“Same order we came out. Oren, you pass Sebastian’s barbell down to him.”
Oren nodded.
Sebastian said, “Eager to get your hands back on my rod?”
Velocity barked.
Oren smirked.
He shrugged.
“Found it pretty light, pretty easy to handle.”
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity tutted.
“Oren’s point.”
Sebastian cursed.
“Pej!”
Binyelum smiled at them.
“We’re keeping score?”
Sebastian pressed his lips into a tight, awkward smile and gave an ironic thumbs up.
“Quantifiable proof of my superiority and value! Something my mom can be proud of!”
Velocity blinked.
“Wow.”
Oren said, “Your mom’s proud of your lightweight rod?”
Sebastian burst into laughter.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Sebastian spat, “Pejudo!”
Jhansi said, “Okay, what the fuck does that mean?”
Binyelum loomed.
“It means we have to get going. C’mon.”
They waved Jhansi along.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She didn’t protest.
Sebastian handed his barbell to Oren, waggled his eyebrows, and fell in behind Jhansi. 
Jhansi stepped up to the doorway of the short corridor.
Fuck.
Okay.
More monster mastication.
Jhansi swallowed.
She paused.
Something about the space inside looked strange.
She dropped to her knees and peered in further.
“Oh shit.”
Sebastian stepped forward alongside Jhansi.
“Oh shit.”
Binyelum said, “What?”
Jhansi said, “It's gone.”
The empty stairwell stared back at her.
Jhansi stood.
Moonlight arced across the cooled pool of blood.
Jhansi turned around.
Binyelum stood there, smirking.
Of course.
Binyelum said, “Of course.”
Jhansi looked back at the stairwell.
“What if it’s waiting behind the door for me?”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They grinned.
“What happens when the monster captures the princess?”
Fuck!
What?
Jhansi blushed.
She shook her head.
“What?”
She shook her head harder.
“Since when am I the princess?”
She shook her head even harder.
“I thought I was just a tryhardling.”
Binyelum’s grin flashed.
“New rank.”
They nodded.
“Princess tryhardling.”
What?!
Jhansi blinked.
“What?!”
Sebastian said, “We can marry her off to a rival kingdom.”
Double what?!
Jhansi glared.
Binyelum shook their head.
“Let's hope we don't have to.”
They sighed theatrically.
“That’ll probably be when she awakens her hidden gift!”
They swept a hand across their throat.
“And then she’ll come back for revenge.”
Wait.
What?
Hidden gift?
Jhansi said, “You think I have a hidden gift?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“We’ll see.”
They pushed Jhansi back down the corridor.
Hey!
Binyelum peered into the stairwell.
“No trail.”
They cupped their chin.
Well what the fuck?
Jhansi said, “How did it move?”
Binyelum looked at her.
“Probably like a clam or–”
They gestured.
“–something.”
Oh shit.
Jhansi blinked.
“Clams can move?”
Binyelum snorted.
“Oh my God, Jhansi.”
Jhansi made a face.
“What?!”
She threw up her hands.
“I don't know!”
Binyelum snickered.
“This is why you’re a princess.”
What?!
Jhansi made a face and crossed her arms.
Binyelum looked back toward the stairwell.
“Okay. I'm gonna go first. Nancy, watch my back. If it doesn't go for the jump scare, Velocity, you come down next. Then Sebastian, Oren, Jhansi, and Nancy.”
Everyone nodded.
Binyelum mounted the stairs.
They clambered partway down the ladder, winked at everyone, and lowered themselves further.
Sebastian deadpanned, “And they were never heard from again.”
Nothing moved in the darkness.
Binyelum reached the landing.
They looked around, shrugged, and waved down Velocity.
Velocity descended the ladder.
They bumped fists.
Binyelum pointed at the door.
Velocity gripped their bat.
They stepped forward.
They raised their bat with their right arm.
Binyelum tensed, holding their machete ready with their left hand and holding their right out to grab Velocity’s wrist.
Velocity turned the door handle and pushed.
It didn't budge.
Velocity paused.
They tried again, pulling.
The door still didn’t budge.
Locked.
Velocity shrugged to themselves.
They turned to Binyelum.
They gave a thumbs up.
The door exploded outward, knocking Binyelum and Velocity over the railing and into the open pit of the stairwell.
Wait.
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity stared up at her.
What the hell had just happened?
A hallucination?
Sebastian handed their barbell to Oren, then climbed down.
Oren mimed throwing Sebastian’s barbell over the edge into the void.
Jhansi giggled.
Sebastian glared.
Oren passed down the barbell.
Sebastian grabbed it with both hands.
“Such a delicate touch, just the way I like it.”
Oren nodded.
Oren replied, “Didn't think you could handle any more than that.”
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Oren said, “That’s three.”
Binyelum smiled.
“That means you’ve earned a new title.”
Wait.
What?
Don’t give anyone else a special title!
Oren gave Binyelum a weird smile.
“Oh boy.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Derp Herp Himbo.”
Oren burst into laughter.
Velocity made a face.
Sebastian made a face.
Nancy made an extreme face.
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity said, “What the fuck was that?”
Sebastian shook his head.
“It doesn’t matter. There can be no justification.”
Nancy shook her head.
Oren’s laughter subsided.
He ran a hand through his hair.
“It’s …”
He gestured.
“Something from the past.”
Sebastian shook his head again.
“It doesn’t matter.”
He shook his head harder.
“No justification.”
Binyelum said, “Title disputes can only be settled via formal blood sports.”
Oren mimed cracking his knuckles.
Sebastian made a face.
“Such a brute.”
Oren frowned.
“Weren’t you just praising my delicate touch?”
Sebastian made a different face.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Oren shrugged.
“Already out of my Herp Derp phase.”
He descended the ladder.
Binyelum said, “But not your Himbo phase?”
Oren reached the landing.
He grinned at Binyelum.
“Why would I ever want to quit that?”
Then the conversation ended.
Nobody moved.
Nobody spoke.
What?
Weird.
Oh!
Right.
Jhansi’s turn.
Jhansi climbed down the ladder, the fire extinguisher smacking her on the head only once.
Perfect.
Nancy followed, gracefully sliding down the ladder.
She flourished her ax with a smile.
Binyelum gestured.
The Asterlings took the stairs at a measured pace.
Binyelum looked relaxed, but they clenched their machete tight.
They reached the next landing.
The door creaked inward.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Dark tendrils whipped over the threshold, roughly grabbing Binyelum before anyone could react, lifting them into the air and spreading their limbs. Hungry barbs split their flesh, pumping poison into their exposed muscles. Their body began to seize. A coiled tendril tightened around their neck, holding them firmly in place. Their eyes bulged. Foam bubbled from their open wounds and spewed from their mouth. The tendril around their neck squeezed. It twisted. It pulled. It separated Binyelum’s head from their shoulders in a bursting shower of blood, the gleaming white of their broken spine reflected in their empty eyes.
The dark shape shuddered.
Nancy patted Jhansi’s head.
What?
Fuck.
Fuck!
Jhansi turned.
Her face felt so hot.
Her chest heaved.
Nancy raised both eyebrows.
Jhansi shook her head.
“It’s not–”
Nancy smirked.
She shook her head, then nodded Jhansi onward.
Jhansi smiled weakly and hurried down the stairs.
Fuck.
The hallucinations.
They wouldn’t stop.
Would they keep getting worse?
For the entire rest of the night?
Fuck.
Should she ask someone about it?
Absolutely fucking not.
Admitting that she had compulsive visions of the Asterlings’ violent deaths really would get her left on the side of the fucking road.
Jhansi banged her other elbow on something.
Fuck!
The same damn metal thing as earlier!
This time she could see it.
The case for a fire extinguisher, mounted on the wall.
Of course.
Binyelum moved into the lobby.
The Asterlings followed.
Mambele's headlights beamed in through the entryway.
Relief washed over Jhansi.
Binyelum gestured the Asterlings outside, themselves keeping watch on the lobby, staring down the hall of elevators as everyone took a turn crossing over the broken door.
Jhansi stepped light and quick, keeping her eyes focused on Mambele, plunging into the cool night air.
Jhansi turned as Binyelum emerged from the building.
She looked up toward the top of the tower, some two-hundred feet overhead.
From down here, Jhansi couldn't see shit.
But.
Somewhere in there lurked the Honey Pot.
Jhansi said, “Should we leave a warning or something?”
Binyelum looked at her with an indecipherable expression.
Sebastian frowned.
“Like what? Cut off their limbs?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“No?”
She shrugged.
“Yes?”
She gestured.
“Maybe?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That's not how this works, tryhardling.”
Oh come on.
Jhansi made a face.
“What? What do you mean? You’re just going to let some other kids get fucking eaten?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Maybe.”
They shrugged again.
“Maybe the alterling will starve and die if we interfere.”
What?
Jhansi scowled.
“What?”
She furrowed her brows.
“Starve?”
Binyelum nodded.
“And not just from lack of attention.”
Ugh.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I thought you said alterlings eat memory cards to change their bodies.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s part of it, yes.”
They gestured.
“Some shapes require upkeep.”
Fair.
But.
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“Okay but why do you care?”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“Because it’s more fun.”
What the fuck?
More fun?
To watch kids die?
Obviously not.
So what?
Had they meant this as some kind of test?
Trick the interloper into admitting their devious plans?
Static blinked to life around the perimeter of Jhansi's interior space.
She scowled.
“Please, Binyelum, tell me how it’s fun to watch kids get eaten.”
Binyelum’s mouth tightened.
They exhaled through their nose.
“That’s not what’s fun, Jhansi.”
Ugh.
The static chimed.
Jhansi deepened her scowl.
“Then why aren’t you trying to stop it?”
She waved her arms around.
“I thought that was the whole point. To save the kids.”
Binyelum pinched the bridge of their nose.
“How many times do I have to tell you, Jhansi?”
They shook their head.
“That’s not how this works.”
The static chimed again, louder, crackling as it pulled away from the walls of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi stamped her foot.
“Then how does it work, Binyelum?”
Binyelum threw up their hands.
“It works however you want it to work.”
Wait.
Not an indictment?
The static fizzled.
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum sighed.
They gestured around.
“It’s just a world–”
They gestured again.
“–with rules.”
They shrugged.
“You can play however the fuck you want.”
What?
A game has rules.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Really?”
She crossed her arms.
“And how exactly do you want to play?”
Binyelum looked directly into Jhansi’s eyes.
“I want to have fun.”
The static hummed.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“How is it fun watching kids die?”
Binyelum stared.
Their nostrils flared.
They sighed.
“It’s fun playing a hard game.”
They gestured.
“It’s fun to watch people make choices.”
They gestured again.
“It’s fun to see the shape of the consequences.”
They lazily threw their arms wide.
“It’s fun to just let it happen, organically.”
They pointed at Jhansi.
“I want to participate, to hurt and be hurt. I don’t want to control the game or shape the outcome. I just want to play.”
Well, fine.
Jhansi shrugged.
“That’s cool. You do you.”
She gestured.
“I want to play the game in a way where I save people.”
Bineylum gave her a look.
They sighed.
“Whatever.”
They shrugged.
“Fine. Have it your way.”
Oh.
Wow.
The static dissipated.
Binyelum gestured.
“See how that works out for you.”
Nice.
An easy victory.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“We will.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They gave Jhansi a wan smirk.
“We sure will, tryhardling.”
A metallic bang cut through the parking lot.
Jhansi turned.
Nancy and Velocity stood on opposite sides of Mambele’s trunk
Velocity bent double and groaned.
Nancy slowly crossed her arms, her mouth creasing with the faintest lines of self-satisfaction.
Velocity shook out their left hand.
“Fuck!”
Nancy rolled her shoulders.
Oren patted Velocity on the back.
Binyelum said, “You thought it would end different this time?”
Velocity shouted, “Ugh!”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Did you at least try a different approach?”
Velocity repeated, louder, “Ugh.”
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum flexed their biceps.
“Displays of physical superiority.”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked away.
Well.
This explained how Velocity had ended up in the back seat instead of riding shotgun.
How the fuck did Velocity think they could beat Nancy?
Velocity stood upright.
They cracked their knuckles.
“Well, whatever.”
They shrugged.
“I still want to reroll for the back seat.”
Binyelum smirked.
“No longer interested in being our princess’s throne?”
Binyelum glanced at Jhansi.
“Some people would consider that an honor.”
What?!
Jhansi’s face burned.
“What?!”
Sebastian raised both hands.
“Don’t include me. I’m not trying to disrupt the hierarchy.”
Binyelum gave him a look, then turned to Oren.
“How about it? Wanna step into the arena?”
Oren shrugged.
“Might as well.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Not the shining paragon of competitive spirit, but good enough.”
Oren gave them a sour look.
Binyelum cupped their chin.
“Let’s see.”
Their voice trailed off.
They looked around the parking lot.
Their gaze landed on Jhansi.
“Jhansi!”
Now what?
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“Yes?”
Binyelum pointed at her.
“Think of a color.”
They nodded.
“Whoever guesses closest will be your new throne.”
Jhansi’s face continued to burn.
Velocity said, “Ah, so the aim is to lose.”
Ugh.
Jhansi stuck out her tongue.
She shook her head.
“What about me? I want to play for my own seat. Make Velocity sit in Oren’s lap or something!”
Velocity waggled their eyebrows at Oren.
Oren winked in response.
Binyelum laughed.
“You’re renouncing your throne, princess? Your title goes with it, you know.”
Good.
Jhansi nodded emphatically.
“Yes.”
She nodded even harder.
“Obviously.”
Binyelum smiled.
“Obviously.”
They paused.
“Unfortunately, that won’t work. Abdication is forbidden. If you want a different title, you have to earn it.”
Jhansi clenched her fists.
“Fuck!”
Binyelum laughed.
“Pick a fucking color, nerd.”
Bastard.
Jhansi glared.
She crossed her arms and huffed.
She looked around the parking lot.
Well, what?
Black.
The overwhelming experience of the netherlume shift.
Except.
It didn’t fit the game very well.
With all other colors equidistant.
So, what?
Hm.
Jhansi nodded.
“I’m ready.”
Sebastian said, “How will you know she’s not cheating?”
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“How would I cheat?”
Binyelum laughed.
“You really think our princess is a cheater.”
Sebastian shrugged.
“I’m just saying–”
He gestured at Jhansi.
“–she’s hard to trust.”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
Binyelum smiled, showing teeth.
“She is.”
What?!
Jhansi gave them a look.
“Hey!”
Bineylum turned to Oren with a sweeping gesture.
“The game begins!”
Oren blinked.
“What? Me?”
Binyelum repeated their gesture.
“Yes!”
Oren made a face.
He lept backward into a pose. He waved both hands in midair, as though pulling energy from somewhere. He paused, inhaled, and thrust both hands forward, palms open wide, as though blasting Jhansi with the energy he had summoned.
“A buttery sunset yellow!”
Oh come on.
Jhansi blinked.
She looked at Binyelum.
“More of this?”
Binyelum ignored her and applauded Oren.
“The paragon of the competitive spirit!”
Oren bowed.
Binyelum pulled both arms behind their back and leaned toward Velocity.
“And what say you, charismatic challenger?”
Velocity snorted.
“Charismatic?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“C’mon, we’re pressed for time.”
Velocity laughed.
They threw their arm out straight, pointing their bat directly at Jhansi’s face. The rush of air sent Jhansi’s hair fluttering. She stared cross-eyed at the barrel of the makeshift weapon.
“Dark blue!”
Damn.
Jhansi made a face.
“Wow.”
She looked at Binyelum.
“Velocity wins.”
Velocity clenched their fists.
“Shit!”
Jhansi shook her head.
“No, I mean.”
She waved her hands.
“Wait.”
She bowed onto one knee, pushing her other leg behind her, sweeping her arm wide in an elaborate, flapping gesture.
She pulled her face into as austere an expression as she could manage.
She pointed directly at Velocity from her outstretched hand.
“You–”
She raised both hands and looked skyward.
“–were perfectly wrong!”
She contorted her face into a mask of fury, brought her arms back down by her sides, and glared at Velocity.
She almost toppled over, but caught herself.
She pushed on.
“The duty of administering judgment during the Sacred Rite of Chromatic Divination has been the birthright of my clan for centuries, and not once in the recorded history of my people have we encountered an answer as wrong as yours!”
She looked back at Binyelum.
“Velocity is, unequivocally, the loser.”
Binyelum clapped.
“Marvelous!”
Velocity made a face.
“Look ma, recognition!”
Oren chuckled.
Binyelum nodded.
“Oren–”
They waved both hands.
“–would you kindly gain access to the transportation vessel and assume your rightful place as our princess’s throne.”
Wow.
Oren nodded.
He turned to Jhansi.
“What was the color?”
Jhansi grinned.
“Bright orange.”
Velocity snorted.
Oren grinned.
Binyelum grinned too.
Oren popped the trunk, but Binyelum shook their head.
“We’re gonna keep our stuff ready going forward.”
Sebastian raised an eyebrow.
“You want my rod flailing around in the back seat?”
Binyelum laughed.
“Good point.”
They shook their head.
“Nobody wants that.”
They gestured.
“Pack that shit away.”
Sebastian stuck out his tongue.
“Pack it into your mom.”
Binyelum waggled a finger.
“AI–”
Sebastian interrupted.
“Yeah right.”
He shut his barbell in the trunk, then filed into the backseat with Oren and Velocity.
Nancy rode shotgun.
Jhansi ducked partway into the vehicle, then turned, taking one last look at the Washington Center Tower.
The Honey Pot flashed before her eyes.
Fuck.
She stepped back onto the asphalt and sprinted around to the passenger’s side door.
Binyelum groaned.
“What now?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“Hang on!”
She turned to Nancy.
“Hey, um, sorry. Can you, er, scootch your knees?”
Nancy blinked at Jhansi, then slowly pulled her knees up to her chest with unwavering grace.
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
“Thanks.”
She popped open the glove compartment.
Binyelum laughed.
“Hey!”
They ducked into Mambele and reached toward Jhansi.
“My privacy!”
Jhansi looked at them.
“A princess has a right to her subjects’ privacy!”
Binyelum paused.
They shook their head.
“I had no idea I’d be crowning such a tyrant.”
Jhansi grinned.
She searched the glove compartment.
She found a pile of envelopes, which she supposed would suffice, but she’d hoped to find something more aesthetic.
She looked at Binyelum.
“Yeah? Have I earned a new title? Tyrant tryhardling?”
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
“What are you looking for?”
Jhansi grinned.
She searched deeper into the glove compartment.
She found an automotive manual beneath the envelopes, which suited her better, but Binyelum might get upset if she started ripping out pages.
She looked at Binyelum.
“My own book of rules.”
Binyelum sighed.
“Jhansi–”
Jhansi made a face.
She searched deeper into the glove compartment.
The corner of a pack of playing cards peeked up at her from the very bottom of the receptacle.
Perfect.
She snatched it up smiled at Binyelum.
“Do you have a pen?”
Binyelum gave her a look.
“Jhansi–”
Jhansi interrupted.
“I’m not leaving a warning, okay?”
She gestured.
“I'm just doing my own thing.”
She paused.
“I'm playing the way I want.”
Binyelum searched her face.
“Passenger’s side door pocket.”
Jhansi looked down.
Folded stacks of maintenance receipts overflowed from the small crevasse.
She plunged her hand into the mess and pulled out a red Sharpie.
“Red.”
It would do.
She opened the pack of cards, squeezed the cardboard, and grabbed the worn, softened corner of a card at random.
The two of hearts.
She set it on Mambele's hood and scrawled a message across its face.
I BELIEVE IN YOU
She added little stars here and there.
For kicks.
Jhansi placed the pack of cards and the Sharpie in her canvas bag.
Binyelum blinked at her over Mambele's hood.
Jhansi hurried back to the shattered door. Staccato footsteps followed her across the parking lot. The collective gazes of the Asterlings followed her like a spotlight.
She examined the shape of the spray of glass, knelt near the center, and delicately lifted a larger piece. A bright moment of pain lit up her middle finger. A thin line of red appeared.
Fucking great.
Jhansi placed the playing card face up on the ground and weighed it down with the piece of glass.
The glass distorted her message, stretching the letters and symbols beyond their original dimensions.
It would make a difference.
Right?
Jhansi whispered, “I hope this helps.”
Binyelum called, “C’mon!”
Jhansi stood and hurried back to Mambele.
Goosebumps prickled her arms as she ducked inside, welcomed without question into an embrace of sound and color.
Oren had said something about Mambele's capacity to alleviate the mental strain of the netherlume shift, right?
It began to make sense.
Jhansi sat in Oren’s lap.
It felt warmer than Velocity's.
Heat rose in her cheeks.
What a weird fucking thought.
Oren smiled.
“Welcome aboard.”
Jhansi’s blush deepened.
Binyelum lowered themselves into Mambele.
They looked straight at Jhansi.
Jhansi’s blush deepened even further.
Fuck.
No.
She pushed through.
She raised her nose and sniffed.
“A suitable palanquin.”
Oren smiled wider.
“If I was your palanquin, wouldn't somebody have to carry me?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“You can crab walk.”
Oren burst into laughter.
Binyelum snorted.
Nancy blinked slowly.
Sebastian recoiled.
“Wow.”
Velocity shook their head.
“Everything becomes a crab eventually.”
Huh.
An unexpected comment from Velocity.
Binyelum looked at Oren.
“Shoulda picked a better color.”
Oren shrugged.
“No problem. I was the divisional crab walking champion two years in a row.”
Sebastian gave Oren a look.
“That–”
He paused.
“–sounds like noneling behavior.”
Oren gave Sebastian a face that turned Jhansi's stomach.
Wow.
Okay.
What the hell did that mean?
She looked around.
“Noneling?”
She didn't get a response.
A shadow flickered across Binyelum’s face.
Everyone else’s expression settled into something uncomfortable.
Fascinating.
What else had made the Asterlings react like this?
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“Is that like the Mezzoforte or whatever?”
Still no reply.
Nancy gave her a weird look.
Pitying?
Sebastian made a harsher face.
“The what?”
Binyelum chuckled darkly.
“No.”
They paused.
“A noneling is nothing like the Mesonoxian.”
They paused again.
They brought a finger to their chin.
“Well. Actually.”
They shrugged.
“Maybe.”
Sebastian raised his eyebrows.
“Maybe?”
Binyelum gave him a look.
“Do you know where the Mesonoxian came from?”
Sebastian closed his mouth.
Binyelum continued.
“Plus, they’re not completely dissimilar.”
Velocity frowned.
“Not dissimilar?”
Okay.
Jhansi couldn’t follow along any further.
“Excuse me.”
She gestured.
“What the fuck is a noneling?”
Everyone blinked at her.
Binyelum opened their mouth, but Oren spoke first.
“On very rare occasions–”
Binyelum gave him a look, but he continued.
“–if a special one survives until the end of the netherlume shift, Egaeus’s gift won’t kill them.”
What the fuck?!
Jhansi opened her mouth, but Oren continued.
“It’ll turn them into a noneling.”
What the entire fuck?!
Special ones didn’t have to die?!
Jhansi glared.
“You told me–”
Oren blinked at her with wide, reproachful eyes.
Oh.
Huh.
Jhansi blinked back at him.
Oren said, “A noneling is pretty much dead.”
He paused.
“It’s a shambling abomination.”
Wow.
What a word.
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh.”
She paused.
“So like a zombie?”
Oren laughed darkly.
“Sure.”
He paused.
“If we ever see one, just fucking run.”
Run?
Jhansi blinked yet again.
“Run?”
Oren shook his head.
“They can’t die.”
He paused again.
“And personally, I’d rather get caught by the Mesonoxian.”
Double wow.
Jhansi frowned.
“If I see one? How would I know?”
Oren nodded.
“You’ll know.”
Huh.
Well.
Triple wow.
Jhansi turned to Binyelum.
“And the Mesonoxian is the only other thing that survives the light of the full moon.”
Binyelum pointed a finger gun at her and pulled the trigger.
“Bingo.”
Fascinating.
Sebastian said, “Are we done?”
Velocity slapped his arm.
“You’re the one who brought it up!”
Sebastian made a face.
“Yeah but I didn’t actually want to talk about it.”
Binyelum clapped.
“Enough!”
Nancy raised an eyebrow.
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity said, “Wow.”
Oren shrugged.
Binyelum nodded.
“The open road calls.”
Jhansi snorted.
Binyelum pulled the driver’s side door closed.
The hood light switched off. The overhead stars lit up. The shifter glowed. It had changed again, into a trapezoidal plane reclined against the dashboard, the face of it marked by dozens of square silicone buttons. A CRT screen filled the top space of the plane, a green light blinking in its center. Binyelum squeezed the clutch trigger on the steering wheel and pressed several of the shifter buttons in a quick sequence. The green light jumped downward on the display. A purple targeting reticle, rendered as a square with two cross lines, closed in on the green light. Binyelum turned the wheel as Mambele reversed.
The green light pulled to the side, and the targeting reticle followed.
Binyelum squeezed the clutch and pressed a different, shorter sequence of buttons.
The green light jumped up toward the top of the display, and the targeting reticle followed.
Mambele pulled out of the parking lot.
The Washington Center receded into the cloak.
Sebastian said something, but Jhansi didn't pay attention.
Relief peaked inside her.
Only for a moment.
A massive wave of exhaustion followed, crashing through her interior space.
What the fuck had just happened?
That hadn’t felt anything like The Rescue.
Jhansi pictured the battered orifice of the Washington Center Tower.
She traced her way back through that ominous lobby, up those hypnotic stairs, straight into the dangling limbs swaying beneath the Honey Pot. The monster’s disgusting mouth pressed hard against her body, smearing her with mucous to ease her passage down its throat. Ropey tendrils squeezed her tight. Barbs dug into her flesh and pumped her full of–
No.
Wait.
That hadn’t happened.
What the fuck?
Why wouldn’t her mind stop doing this?
Jhansi looked around at the other teenagers.
Velocity said, “–sucked her fuckin’ dick!”
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum said, “For fun or for profit?”
Jhansi blinked again.
Sebastian said something too, but she didn’t pay attention.
What the fuck?
Everyone seemed so normal.
Well.
Of course they did.
Not their first rodeo.
Everyone else had seen this …
How many times?
Hundreds?
The alterling and the dead body hadn’t phased them at all.
Jhansi blinked yet again.
She realized she sat staring at Oren.
A cottage-style home illuminated by a buttery yellow exterior nebulite rushed past behind him.	
Oren smiled, the soft curves of his face pillowing upward.
“Hey.”
He paused.
“How are you doing?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked.
“Uh.”
She blinked again.
She looked around.
Nancy sat leaning back in her seat, hands behind her head, eyes closed.
Sebastian leaned past Jhansi, grinning at something he had just said.
Velocity hunched up over the back of Binyelum’s seat and added their input.
Binyelum laughed, one hand on the steering wheel, the other over their mouth.
Well.
It couldn’t get more private than that.
Jhansi shrugged at Oren.
“I’m fine.”
Oren’s mouth flattened.
“Don’t bullshit me. That was a lot. How are you feeling?”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
She searched her interior.
White noise tension.
The same as always.
Jhansi shrugged.
“I don’t know.”
Oren chuckled.
“What do you know?”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
“Hey!”
Oren raised both eyebrows.
“Am I wrong?”
 Jhansi sneered.
“Maybe.”
Oren nodded.
He paused.
He looked out the rear window.
“That was pretty fucked up.”
Jhansi followed his gaze.
“The Tower?”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
Jhansi nodded too.
“Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.”
She again looked around at everyone, then back out the rear window.
“Everyone seems fine though.”
Oren looked at her.
“Do they?”
Jhansi made a face.
“Well yeah.”
She gestured around, as though that offered enough explanation.
Oren ran a hand through his hair.
He reached into the pocket of his varsity jacket and pulled out a pack of gum.
He meticulously selected one stick from the collective, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth.
Light slid across the aluminum wrapping.
Oren wadded the wrapping, pushed it into the package, and returned the package to his pocket.
He looked at Jhansi.
“I almost shit my fucking pants.”
What?
Oren?
What the hell did Oren have to fear?
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Oren raised both eyebrows.
“What what?”
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“You were afraid?”
Oren’s expression softened, but he kept his eyebrows up.
“Obviously.”
He paused.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
Jhansi made a face.
“I’ve watched you kill endlings.”
She paused.
“You used to be an endling!”
She gestured.
“You’re used to this.”
Oren looked down at his chainlock.
Hard edges flashed beneath a passing nebulite.
Oren looked back at Jhansi.
“No.”
He shook his head.
“I’m really not.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Oren looked back out the rear window.
“I’m really not used to this.”
What?
That didn’t make sense.
Jhansi shook her head.
“But you’re so–”
She paused, embarrassed at the word about to leave her mouth.
“–cool.”
Oren smiled softly.
Not the expected reaction.
Oren shook his head.
“Thanks Jhansi.”
What?
This didn’t make any sense at all.
Jhansi frowned.
“If you’re scared all the time–”
Well.
What exactly did she want to ask?
Jhansi shrugged.
“How do you do it?”
Oren looked at Jhansi.
His smile warmed.
“She begins to understand.”
What?
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“What?”
Oren laughed.
“I cope, Jhansi.”
Double what?
Jhansi frowned.
“What?”
Oren laughed again, quieter, shaking his head.
“I cope.”
He shrugged.
“I find a way to make it worth it.”
He paused.
A faraway look settled on his face.
He returned.
“I find a way to make it worth it.”
He focused on Jhansi.
“How do you cope?”
What?
Cope?
Like.
That thing people do when they feel weak?
Jhansi, feel weak?
Static crackled along the perimeter of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi snorted.
“I don’t need to cope.”
Oren closed his mouth.
He sighed through his nose.
“Alright.”
He put up a hand.
“I won’t press it.”
He put down his hand.
“Just, think about it.”
Hm.
Jhansi opened her mouth, but Oren leaned past her to join the other conversation.
“Choggie sounds like a bad euphemism for a dick!”
Everyone else laughed.
Jhansi groaned.
She looked out the driver’s side window.
Mambele rushed around a roundabout illuminated by blue nebulites.
Two blue endlings wearing black uniforms hunched on all fours near the center of the island.
They tore into the meat of a body with their massive teeth.
Orange blood coated the scene.
Jhansi jostled as Mambele went around the curve.
Well fuck.
White noise caught Jhansi’s attention.
She looked around.
Binyelum had turned on the radio.
They spun the dial.
A familiar voice bleated for just a moment.
The Bright Veins.
The white noise returned.
The warm velvet of an unfamiliar feminine voice filled the cabin. 
Goosebumps rose on Jhansi’s skin.
“–fell off the leaderboard last night.”
Jhansi blinked.
The texture of that gentle purr had an almost hypnotic quality.
Binyelum took their hand off the dial.
Velocity said, “Aww, we missed it.”
They smacked the back of Binyelum’s seat.
“Who died?”
The voice continued.
“Next up, hard traffic.”
A brief jingle played, airy lofi pads underneath a twinkling upward arpeggio.
“Uncensored, bedlights, I’m not sure how I feel about these open roads. A night this quiet, that’s gotta be a fairy tale.”
The voice paused.
“But I know I’m not dreaming.”
 The voice paused again.
“I do have a couple updates for you.
“First, a riddle. What can you never escape, even in death? No, bedlights, I’m not talking about the disapproval of your parents. I’m talking about your silhouette. Soundwaves south of town say there’s a brand new gang forming ranks, Silhouette Entropy. Some kind of mercenary outfit. Spec the situation. I imagine they’re looking for hands, if it suits you.”
Binyelum blinked.
“Well that’s something.”
The voice continued.
“Next. Any of you bedlights spec a big bright light north of town? You’re right to feel some commotion sickness. No confirmation on who did what, but I’m catching rumors of a renegade colorless.”
The voice paused.
“Spec your friends, spec your backs.”
Velocity blanched.
“Oh.”
They blinked.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum looked at them in the rearview mirror.
The voice continued.
“Next up, detours.”
The jingle played again, with a slightly different arpeggiated melody.
“Daytime downtown road construction means nighttime nuisance road obstruction for all my little bedlights. Spec your step near the high rise apartments north of the river. Fourth, Eighth, and Twelfth are torn up between Chancellor and Faraday.
“While you’re at it, spec your way near the river. We’ve got a statistically impossible daytime interference event–Ironsight Crossing Bridge is up. That’s right. No clue how that happened, but my, what a blessing. Don’t let your wicked wheels send you diving, I hate underwater ghost stories.
“Finally, as I’m sure you’re all well aware, completion of the off ramp expansion for exit six on US nine is more than a month behind schedule. Daytime news has kept us all very informed, I won’t waste essence imitating inferiors. Just stay mindful if you drift that way.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Alright.”
The voice continued.
“Next up, warning signs.”
The jingle played again, with yet another melody.
“Right. Let’s not linger here. Caught some rumors, no confirmations. But. Narrow margins say we’ve sighted the Mesonoxian already.”
Binyelum exhaled slowly.
The voice allowed the silence to linger.
A different version of the jingle played.
“That’s the latest push for now, little bedlights. Keep it bright out there. Dr. Satelleyez, at your service. I’m your twilight jockey, a shooting star to light your way, by your side ‘til the bitter end, right here on one-four-oh dot-one-five NSE. ”
A variation on the jingle played, longer and with more arpeggios, ushering out the doctor.
Silence followed.
Velocity said, “We rolled a boring one.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“We’ve got a first hour Mesonoxian sighting.”
Velocity made a face.
“Unconfirmed.”
Oren said, “Silhouette Entropy is interesting.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Silhouette Entropy is very interesting.”
They paused.
“I wonder who’s running the scene. What are they doing to pull enough special ones together to form an entirely new gang?”
Nancy gestured as though jerking someone off.
What?!
Wow.
Okay.
Everyone stared at Nancy.
Binyelum burst into laughter.
“I’m joining Nancy’s cult.”
Oh what the hell.
Jhansi’s stomach tightened.
She scowled.
“What the hell was that anyway?”
Everyone raised their eyebrows at her.
She probably hadn’t controlled her tone very well.
Sebastian said, “You’re unfamiliar with the application of pleasure?”
What?!
Jhansi went red.
She shook her hands.
“That’s not what I meant!”
Sebastian shrugged.
Binyelum laughed.
Great.
Jhansi scowled.
Binyelum said, “What was what, princess?”
Ugh.
A fucking rescue.
Gross.
Jhansi gestured.
“The radio person.”
Oren nodded.
“Right.”
He grabbed Jhansi’s wrist.
His grip felt surprisingly warm.
Oren squeezed.
“Someone’s using their gift to disseminate information.”
Velocity giggled.
“Seminate.”
Jhansi’s entire body went red.
Binyelum said, “More than likely it's a network of someones.”
Oren made a face, but didn't say anything.
Sebastian smirked at Jhansi.
“C’mon, you could've at least put that one together.”
Ugh.
Fuck off.
What would prove how much Jhansi had actually internalized?
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“How do we know we can trust them?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Nice trying, latecomer.”
Velocity giggled again.
“Better than prejac.”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
Sebastian blinked too.
“Wow.”
Mambele passed around another roundabout, this one illuminated by a dark magenta nebulite.
Binyelum said, “Alright, we’re getting close.”
Velocity giggled yet again.
“Getting close.”
Bineylum smirked at them in the mirror.
“You took the bait.”
Velocity slapped their forehead.
“Fuck! My points!”
Jhansi looked around.
“Close?”
Binyelum snorted.
They looked at Jhansi in the rearview mirror.
“To Bridgemall.”
Oh.
Oh.
Right.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
They had more to do.
Jhansi looked toward Binyelum.
Binyelum continued.
“Hard to say what it’s gonna be like in there. If they’re still around, we’ll need to get in and out as quickly as possible. If they’re gone, we’ll have to figure out where they went.”
Fuck.
The dangling corpse of Pooh Bear appeared again in Jhansi’s mind.
She wouldn't hate it if the endlings had already left.
Binyelum gestured.
“The memory I pulled didn't depict anything outranking green.”
They looked around.
“Anyone see different?”
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum nodded.
“Cool.”
They tightened their grip on the steering wheel.
“Though, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything.”
They paused.
“Anybody see any guards posted?”
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum frowned.
“Annoying.”
They paused.
“We should still assume there are guards.”
They paused again.
“Everyone’s familiar with Bridgemall, right?”
Nobody disagreed.
Bineylum nodded.
“Cool. Seems likely we'll find guards positioned near the entrance to the parking lot; on top of those two parking structures; and right outside the entryway.”
Jhansi pictured the approach to Bridgemall.
The long, flat plane of a parking lot preceded both the mall’s north and south entryways. A median planted with twisting trees bisected each lot. A four-story parking structure flanked both the east and west side of each entrance.
Jhansi had only a single memory of her parents parking at the top of one of those structures.
She had held tight to a steel railing warmed by the summer sun and leaned forward, not quite over the edge of the structure, captivated by the sparkling ribbon of water below, and by the dark line of the mall’s shadow wavering on the river’s surface. 
Binyelum continued.
“We should expect at least one moving patrol, too.”
They paused.
“Unless anybody has any better ideas, I’m gonna park in the drainage ditch between the avenue and the parking lot.”
Nobody spoke.
Bineylum nodded.
“Cool. We're not really a team built for stealth kills, so let's focus on getting in clean.”
They paused.
Oren spoke before they could continue.
“We could lure the green endling out into the parking lot?”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“That's not a bad idea, but–”
They shook their head.
“–they’d probably just send out the lower ranks to deal with us. We’d have to kill all of them.”
They paused.
“We might actually be able to pull it off.”
They paused again.
“But I’d rather not risk it.”
Oren shrugged.
Nobody argued.
Binyelum continued.
“We’ll probably have to kill the guards right at the entrance.”
They paused.
“Nancy and I will take point on that.”
Nancy nodded.
Bineylum glanced at Sebastian.
“Sebastian, you hang back with Velocity. Only heal us if we absolutely need it.”
They paused.
“Or if I tell you.”
Sebastian and Velocity nodded.
Bineylum glanced at Oren.
Oren raised both hands.
“Yeah, yeah, my gift’s the wrong fit for sneaking missions.”
Binyelum nodded.
“A model team player.”
Wait.
Did Bineylum expect Jhansi to contribute by doing nothing too?
Jhansi leaned forward.
“What about me?”
Bineylum raised both eyebrows.
“You forgot already?”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“Forgot what?”
Binyelum gave an exaggerated sigh.
They waved a hand.
“Hang on, princess.”
Wait!
Forgot what?
Jhansi huffed.
Bineylum continued.
“My memory only confirmed endlings posted in the food court. Can anybody else confirm endlings posted elsewhere inside?”
Nobody spoke.
Bineylum frowned.
“Frustrating. That doesn’t mean anything, but maybe we’ll get lucky.”
They paused.
“Once we’re inside, we’ll pass the first spiral staircase and make our way to the top floor at the next escalator. If we find any guards, we’ll probably have to kill them, but I really don’t want to leave too many corpses around. Regardless of what happens, the goal is to get to the top floor, then the food court. From there–”
Oren interrupted.
“What if they try to trap us on the top floor?”
Binyelum looked at him in the rearview mirror.
They paused.
“The green guy will probably be on top, and I don’t want to deal with how many guards will be posted near the stairs and escalators closest to the food court.”
Oren shrugged.
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“Once we get close enough to the green endling, Velocity, share your gift with Oren, to send Nancy and I directly to the target. They’ll be on high alert as soon as Oren’s gift takes effect, but if we’re lucky, we’ll be able to catch the target–”
Velocity interrupted.
“Tango.”
Binyelum blinked.
“What?”
Velocity gestured.
“Target sounds lame and boring. Call it a tango.”
Oren blinked at them.
“That’s not what tango means.”
Velocity shrugged.
“It sounds cool.”
Binylum rubbed their forehead.
They sighed.
“Unfortunately it does sound cool.”
Velocity pumped their fist.
“Yeah!”
Fucking dork.
Binyelum continued.
“If we’re lucky, we’ll catch the tango completely off guard, and Nancy can take it down with her ax. If not, I’ll share my gift with Nancy, and that will take care of it.”
Wait.
A guaranteed KO?
Binyelum looked at Sebastian again.
“At that point, Nancy will need healing.”
Wait.
What?
Binyelum continued.
“Velocity–”
They paused.
“Velocity, how fast is your recharge?”
Velocity shrugged.
They mimed dusting off their shoulders.
“Pretty fast.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Of course.”
They grinned.
“Alright. If Nancy needs healing, Velocity, share your gift with Sebastian as soon as you possibly can. Either way, the rest of you start making your way toward Nancy and I, regardless of what it looks like. I’ll grab the green endling’s memory card. We’ll all meet up and run like fucking hell.”	
They paused.
“I’ll take point, and take responsibility if the plan needs to change.”
They paused again.
“Everybody got it?”
Jhansi blinked.
She hardly understood any of that, but it sounded really cool.
Binyelum turned a knob on the dashboard and Mambele’s headlights flicked off.
The cloak enveloped the sedan almost entirely, limiting visibility to less than a meter.
Binyelum didn’t slow down.
Jhansi swallowed.
“What about me?”
Binyelum looked at her in the rearview mirror.
“Right.”
They paused.
“Princess, your job is to retrieve as many memory cards as possible.”
Oh.
Shit.
Right.
Fuck.
The Honey Pot flashed before Jhansi’s eyes.
“That’s gonna be a lot.”
Binyelum smiled.
They looked back at the dark road.
“How many shares does everyone have?”
Fuck.
Everyone with a gift replied at once.
“Twelve!”
“Three.”
“Six.”
Nancy held up one finger.
Binyelum laughed.
“Let’s try that again.”
They paused.
“Oren, how many shares do you have?”
“Six.”
“Reliable. Velocity?”
“Twelve.”
“Nice. Sebastian?”
“Three.”
“Healthy. And I’ve got two.”
They paused, then looked at Jhansi in the rearview mirror.
“Remember. Focus on collecting memory cards. Nancy and I will be out front; that's way too dangerous for you. Keep near Oren, Velocity, and Sebastian. Don't fall too far behind. As soon as an endling goes down, grab its memory card.”
They paused.
“Hold onto it.”
They paused again.
“That was good thinking, grabbing that bag.”
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum continued.
“Listen for whoever needs a recharge, and prioritize delivery over acquisition. It’ll be up to you to prioritize who gets the next card, moment to moment, so pay attention to what’s going on. Try to memorize how many shares everyone has, but don’t forget, someone might need a memory card to overcome their refractory period. Do your best to make sure everybody stays alive.”
Holy fuck.
Binyelum continued.
“If you can keep track of which memory cards came from which endlings, that could help inform your decision making. It’s impossible to tell how many shares are within any given memory card, but higher ranking enemies generally possess memory cards that impart more shares.”
Barely keeping up, but okay.
Binyelum continued.
“Also, Velocity’s gift will use up one of their own shares, plus a variable number of the recipient’s shares.”
For fuck’s sake.
Bineylum nodded.
“Did you get all that?”
Maybe Sebastian really had known better.
Maybe she should just stay behind with Mambele.
Well.
How would it feel, watching the Asterlings walk off into the cloak toward Bridgemall without her?
Jhansi shook her head.
“Yeah, I got it.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Good girl.”
Jhansi blushed.
She pushed through it.
“What about the new-game-plus?”
Binyelum paused.
“I don’t really think you’ll have time for that. But–”
They paused again.
“–if you collect six memory cards, you can start new-game-plus’ing. And–”
They paused one more time.
“–you’ll get a new title.”
Special recognition?
Jhansi beamed.
“Fuck yeah! The princess takes the throne.”
Bineylum smiled.
“We’ll see.”
They paused.
“We’re here.”
Wait.
Holy fuck.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Wait!
Binyelum pulled Mambele gently to the right. Jhansi bounced in Oren's lap as the sedan mounted the curb, then trundled down into the wide, shallow ditch. Binyelum squeezed the clutch trigger and tapped several buttons on the shifter display, putting Mambele in park. They turned off the ignition and pocketed the key. The engine bells quieted.
Binyelum grabbed the door handle.
“Here we go.”
The door clicked open.
Bineylum stood and popped the seat forward, then popped the trunk. Nancy got out and popped the seat forward for Sebastian. Sebastian pushed himself out, and Velocity followed. They left the door open.
Oren looked up at Jhansi.
He made a face.
“C’mon, princess.”
Jhansi blinked.
She stood and stepped into the night.
A cold breeze pressed against her.
Her skirt whipped across her legs.
It hadn’t felt like this earlier.
Even on top of the Washington Square Tower.
Maybe because of their proximity to the river?
Oren climbed from the back seat and left the door open.
Sebastian retrieved his barbell from the trunk and left the latch open.
Jhansi looked around.
She couldn’t see shit.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched the fire extinguisher to her chest.
Wait.
Really?
Jhansi flushed.
She awkwardly thrust her arms down by her sides.
Binyelum crouched, motioning for everyone to follow.
Everyone obeyed.
Jhansi almost fell on her ass in the mud.
Stupid.
Why did they have to crouch anyway?
Who the hell could possibly see them?
Bineylum grabbed a handful of mud and smeared it along the golden blade of their machete.
They gave everyone a look.
Everyone copied Binyelum, dulling the gleam of their weapons.
Seriously?
Reflected light, in the netherlume shift?
For fuck's sake, they could probably just walk right up to the entryway.
Bineylum stared at Jhansi.
What?
Oh.
Shit.
Jhansi smeared mud on her fire extinguisher.
Gross.
Bineylum nodded.
They crawled on their stomach up the side of the ditch, then peeked over the lip.
Crawling through mud.
Great.
Binyelum looked back and waved.
They stood back into a crouch and headed up over the lip of the ditch.
Everyone followed in a cluster, with Nancy leading.
Well.
Okay.
No crawling through mud.
But.
Jhansi had a hard time staying upright on the incline.
The mud sucked at her flats.
She fell forward.
She caught herself with one hand, the mud splashing up into her face.
Fucking gross.
Jhansi held the fire extinguisher tight against her chest and climbed upward.
Her elbow banged against a rock.
Shit.
A long hiss escaped from between Jhansi’s teeth.
Crawling through mud after all.
Jhansi mounted the lip of the ditch.
The hard line of the parking lot cut through the frail grass a dozen meters ahead.
The space beyond could have reached to the horizon.
Jhansi couldn’t see shit.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched the fire extinguisher to her chest.
The Asterlings pressed forward without a sound.
An emerald green nebulite glow swelled at the far end of Jhansi’s vision.
The chroma had a deep, rich quality, but not much penetrating power.
The vague silhouette of both parking structures emerged from the cloak, framing the glow.
So the glow came from within the mall.
Binyelum paused.
It almost looked like an ear on their headband twitched.
“Something’s not right.”
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched tighter to her muddy fire extinguisher.
Double fuck.
How fucking long would it take to reach the entryway?
They had fucking nowhere to run or hide.
Binyelum moved quickly.
Everyone kept up.
Jhansi stood slightly out of her crouch as she moved.
The parking lot dragged past on all sides.
Something dark and towering manifested from the cloak.
It reared above Binyelum, reaching skyward with a massive fist already smeared with the blood of teenagers.
Wait.
Fuck.
No.
A tree, planted in a median.
Jhansi nearly tripped over the cement barrier.
Stupid.
Fucking.
Bullshit.
Binyelum reached the parking structure and crouched low against the wall.
They peered over the wall, into the void of the structure.
They shook their head.
They looked back at everyone, then hurried along the length of the wall to the west, toward the entryway.
Everyone followed.
Jhansi squished herself down as far as she could.
Her legs started to ache.
Binyelum paused at the corner of the parking structure, leaned around it, and swore quietly.
“Pej.”
They leapt up.
What?
They looked around once, then pelted forward.
What the hell?
Everyone followed.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi squeezed her fire extinguisher as she ran.
She stepped up a short stairway onto a cement walk.
A three-story facade loomed from the cloak, seven meters of dark stone atop three and a half meters of marble.
Heavy letters glared down at Jhansi.
BRIDGEMALL
They swooped up and back down, suggesting the shape of a bridge.
Green light poured from behind the glass entryway doors.
Two piles of pink meat and parted bone framed the entryway.
Oh.
Fuck.
White stuff oozed in spurts from the viscera.
Splashes of orange blood dripped from the marble walls and glass entryway doors.
The meat had something mixed in with it.
Slate gray fabric.
Bineyum paused in front of the rightmost pile.
A smashed eyeball stared at Jhansi.
She couldn't help but stare back.
Other details came into focus.
Gleaming teeth, protruding from a shattered jaw.
A long, slimey rope of intestines.
A slurry of assorted organs.
Jhansi retched.
Binyelum examined the meat, then looked at the Asterlings, then looked into the dark green interior of Bridgemall.
“They’re fighting in there.”
What?
Oren nodded.
“Yeah.”
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“Who’s fighting?”
Binyelum gave her a look.
“Endlings.”
Oh.
Shit.
Really?
Sebastian said, “We could just wait until they kill each other?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“We should watch. We’ll be fucked if the tango dies and these other guys offer up that memory card.”
Sebastian sighed.
Binyelum looked at everyone.
“Let’s go.”
They pulled on the handle of a manual door.
It swung open easily.
Jhansi marveled that the endlings hadn’t battered it down.
The Asterlings squeezed through into the vestibule.
The hard carpet squeaked beneath Jhansi’s flats.
They passed through a second set of glass doors into the long chamber of the mall.
Inhuman screams of distant violence echoed toward them.
A wide, spiraling staircase wound upward to Jhansi’s left.
Above her hung a constellation of spiraling ceramic stalactite sculptures, smooth edges catching and holding the ambient green light in lustrous curving bands.
The chamber receded into the distance.
Benches, kiosks, stairways, and escalators obscured the view.
A hint of the ice rink shimmered ahead of them.
Bineylum gestured into the mall.
“We’ll stick to the plan as best we can. I’ll call out any changes.”
They directed the Asterlings forward along the left wall, not at a full sprint, but close.
The soles of their shoes clacked against the marble floor.
They passed an Auntie Anne’s Pretzels.
Then a shuttered optometrist’s office.
Then a Zumiez.
The shadowed merchandise beyond the lowered gate seemed to Jhansi like liminal artifacts from another dimension.
Did that mannequin just move?
They neared an escalator leading up to the second floor mezzanine.
A corpse sprawled heavily over the railing.
A blue endling, wearing a black uniform.
Its head stared upside-down from the floor, but otherwise the body remained intact.
The white shock of the monster’s severed spine winked at Jhansi.
Jhansi looked away.
Where had she seen a black uniform, anyway?
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
“Does this have to do with that eviscerated endling on the roundabout?”
Bineylum turned to her.
They looked upset.
“What eviscerated endling?”
They paused.
“What roundabout?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked.
She gestured.
“I dunno.”
She gestured again.
“Some endlings on some roundabout. They wore black uniforms.”
She shrugged.
“It looked like they were eating another endling.”
Binyelum didn’t reply.
They flattened their mouth into a straight line.
Shit.
Fuck.
Jhansi’s chest tightened.
She glanced at the other Asterlings.
Everyone looked upset.
A piercing shriek rushed through the chamber.
Binyelum said, “I didn’t see anything like that.”
Okay?
Jhansi flushed.
“Oh.”
Binyelum kept staring at her.
“Why didn’t you say something?”
A whiplash of static rang through Jhansi’s interior space.
“I thought you saw.”
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“I didn’t.”
The static again.
Sebastian flared his nostrils.
“See?”
He looked around.
“I don’t fucking trust her.”
Oh come on.
Jhansi glared at Sebastian.
“What the fuck?”
Velocity pushed Sebastian back a pace.
“You still think princess is a bad guy?”
Sebastian gestured.
“She could be leading us into a trap!”
Oh double come on!
Seriously?
Jhansi flailed.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
Binyelum waved a hand.
“Shut up.”
They shook their head.
“We have to do this either way.”
They gestured up the escalator.
“C’mon.”
They hopped the small gate and pelted up the inert stairs.
Sebastian glowered at Jhansi.
Jhansi sneered back.
Everyone followed Binyelum.
Jhansi couldn’t quite mount the gate.
She growled at herself, shoved it out of the way, and hurried after the Asterlings.
They switched back onto a different escalator and continued to the third floor.
A light fixture hung in space alongside the second escalator.
The colorful branding of a rentable third space greeted Jhansi as she stepped onto the third floor.
The Asterlings ran on.
The pristine, eerie eye of the ice skating rink watched from below as their shadows bucked along the ceiling.
A brighter light flickered further on.
The food court.
Articulate shapes clashed against the light.
Bodies in combat.
They passed a hexagonal alcove of glass elevators situated along the exterior wall, each lift a portal to the outside.
Darkness swelled in vertical lines.
Binyelum slowed and crouched.
They gestured at everyone, then pointed toward the food court.
Jhansi followed their lead.
She scooted closer to Binyelum.
“I’m sorry.”
Binyelum didn’t look at her.
“I said shut up.”
They moved forward.
Everyone followed.
More spiraling sculptures hung above the food court, their corkscrew silhouettes smeared across the glass dome void. Twin stairways looped in wide arcs downward around the space, connecting all three stories. Tables and chairs littered the scene, some overturned, others completely obliterated.
Each reinforced glass shelf hung gemlike in the green light, crystalline in clarity, all but invisible save for the violent reflections surging across their surfaces.
Blue and red endlings in slate gray and black uniforms lunged at each other, grappling, snarling, spitting, cleaving flesh, crushing limbs, snapping off body parts, grimacing with manic delight at each new ruined body. 
Corpses lay everywhere, frozen totems of terror suspended a hundred meters above the river’s dark water.
In the center of the second floor glass shelf a purple endling in a black uniform dueled a green endling in a slate gray uniform.
Bineylum crouched along the mezzanine railing and peered out to watch.
Everyone else followed their lead.
Jhansi gripped the railing reflexively, squeezing it every time a howl of pain rose above the violence.
She made a face.
The green endling circled around its opponent.
The green endling …
What the fuck?
In place of a head, a muscular, prehensile appendage grew from the monster’s neck. A gleaming claw extruded from the swollen tip. The appendage undulated. It whipped against the air, snapping loud enough for Jhansi to hear. The claw flashed bright.
The mouth on the monster’s stomach opened wide, teeth and tusks pistoning apart.
A roar filled the chamber.
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
The endling’s jaws slammed shut.
Light flashed across the pair of eyes glaring from the monster’s chest, leaving behind pupils like pinpricks.
It huffed through flared nostrils, a low growl rising slowly to follow.
The tango.
The purple endlings stood unmoving, even as the other circled around it.
Two pointed plates of bone jutted in parallel from the monster’s collarbone.
More plates trailed down the small of the monster’s back, diminishing in size and converging.
A spray of thick flagella sprouted from between the largest two plates. Some of the appendages rolled down its back. Some stood coiled, turning to follow the green endling.
Sensory organs?
Thin barbs glistened on the end of each.
A tusked mouth lined with bladed teeth gaped from both sides of the endling's body. A muscular arm ending in a clawed hand sprouted from each throat, along with a clawed prehensile appendage. Saliva dribbled in a perpetual stream from both open orifices.
Two arms.
Two whips.
And that bundle of flagella.
The advantage seemed pretty obvious.
The monster left its arms and whips hanging loosely by its side.
Cocky much?
The eyes on the monster’s chest narrowed.
Fat lips peeled back from the x-shaped mouth on its stomach.
The lines of the mouth split open, retracting to expose converging jaws lined with teeth that curved to razor points.
The jaws parted.
A long, bright red tongue lolled out.
Longer.
And longer.
A taunt?
Both monsters wore uniforms perfectly tailored to fit their grotesque forms.
Fascinating.
Binyelum’s eyes narrowed.
“Hm.”
The green endling rushed.
Heavy boots hammered against glass.
The monster’s whip-like appendage trailed behind it.
The purple endling remained unmoving.
It tensed its coiled flagella.
The green endling stepped into range.
The purple endling struck, spiraling its flagella around each other to mimic a single limb, every barb converging to the same point.
The green endling crashed to a halt on all fours.
It lashed with its clawed whip, throwing the organ in a tight arc toward the bunched up flagella.
Light winked off the lethal edge.
The flagella dispersed, pulling back in a halo.
The purple endling finally turned.
It threw both clawed whips toward the green endling's slashing appendage.
The green endling had already begun to reach upward with one hand.
It grabbed its own clawed whip and yanked downward.
The purple endling’s strike missed by degrees.
The green endling’s clawed whip smashed against the floor.
Jhansi winced.
The purple endling reared back, braced itself, and threw both arm-bundles forward. The green endling smashed its hands into the glass floor and launched itself to the left, flicking its prehensile appendage neatly downward. The purple endling screamed. Orange blood sprayed. Severed flagella tumbled to the floor. The purple endling planted both feet, raised its left arm-bundle, and brought the mass of it down. The green endling had just enough time to balance itself and take a heavy step forward before the cascade of barbed flagella made contact.
Binyelum said, “Fuck.”
The green endling crashed supine against the floor. The purple flagella writhed as they wrapped around the green endling’s body. They tensed, trying to keep the monster pinned down. The purple endling grinned, the lips around its vertical mouth curling outward, and stepped forward. It raised its other arm-bundle. Orange blood dripped from the several severed appendages. The bundle twisted around itself, the barbed ends coalescing, pointing down toward the monster's trapped prey.
Binyelum repeated, “Oh fuck,” this time with anticipation.
They hissed, “Get it!”
Before the purple endling could strike, the green endling struck out with its clawed appendage, straight through the opening in its opponent’s defenses, at the same time grabbing and pulling with its left hand at the flagella holding it down. Several flagella snapped off beneath the claws’ razor edges. The purple endling stumbled, howling. The soaring claw found its mark, piercing deep between those pointed plates. The purple endling's interrupted attack struck against the glass with a ringing impact. The monster toppled onto its opponent.
Binyelum again repeated, “Oh fuck,” now with genuine glee.
The two combatants devolved into a blur of glittering claws and teeth. Jhansi couldn't distinguish between their screams. Orange blood fountained as the green endling tore and bit, chewing through strands of purple flesh. Its clawed appendage flailed above the whirlwind, stabbing downward recklessly, ricocheting off those pointed plates just as often as it struck true. The purple endling fought in kind, stabbing frantically with however many flagella it could, the tendrils of muscle billowing into the air before every strike.
Binyelum grinned, their eyes flashing.
“Holy fuck.”
A pool of blood spread outward from the interlocked monsters.
Red and blue endlings continued to obliterate each other around both floors of the food court.
Jhansi panted.
A cold darkness pushed her away from the world, into her interior. But her body felt hot. An eager heat pulled at her from somewhere.
The dark shape said, {“That would feel so good.”}
Jhansi said, {“What the fuck?”}
The dark shape said, {“You want to feel good like that.”}
Jhansi reached for anything with spikes inside her. Static shards pierced her hand. She grabbed tight and lashed out, striking wildly at her interior space.
Jhansi screamed, {“No I don't!”}
The claw at the end of the green endling's prehensile appendage trailed white afterimages. The claw found purchase in the purple endling’s right eye and pushed in deep. Killcolors flashed. A low, rumbling killchime signaled the end.
Binyelum beamed.
“They fucking did it!”
The green endling kicked at the slumped purple corpse, shoving it onto the floor, and pushed itself to its feet. It loomed over its opponent, opened its jaws, and screamed. Its clawed appendage whipped through the air, trailing orange blood, before stabbing down into the body again, then again. White stuff squeezed out from the gashes.
Binyelum said, “That's our cue.”
Oren said, “Oh shit,” and pointed out into the food court.
Three masked teenagers pelted straight toward the escalators at the other end of the passage. One wore a full face diver’s mask and carried a spear-headed shovel; another wore a surgical mask and carried a chef’s knife; the last wore a conical knight’s helm and carried a sledgehammer. They maintained a tight formation.
Binyelum cursed, “Pejudo!”
They ran.
“C’mon. Escalator. Up.”
Nancy rushed out behind them. Oren followed, then Velocity. Sebastian scowled at Jhansi.
“You first.”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She hurried ahead of Sebastian. Something changed when she stepped beyond the safety of the escalator. The proximity of the carnage screamed at her senses. She stopped, paralyzed after only a couple paces.
A red endling in a slate gray uniform reared back and kicked hard at the chest of a wounded blue endling in a black uniform. The blue endling toppled backward. The red endling followed through on the kick, stomping hard onto its opponent's stomach. It leaned down and screamed in the blue endling’s face. Light glinted off its claws. It grabbed the other’s head in both hands, digging every claw deep into the flesh of the blue endling’s neck, and pulled. Orange blood sprayed. The blue endling’s eyes rolled back. Its tongue lolled out. It gurgled blood. Killcolors flashed. The blue endling’s head separated from its body with a squelching crunch, its fractured spine sliding free as white stuff bubbled out.
Jhansi’s stomach turned.
Sebastian pushed her.
“C’mon!”
The red endling turned toward them.
“Come the fuck on, Jhansi.”
Jhansi didn’t need further encouragement. She turned and ran, nearly stumbling up the inert escalator steps. The fire extinguisher banged against her chest. She gripped it even tighter.
Sebastian shoved her up the steps, calling up to the others.
“Red guy coming!”
Binyelum had already reached the second floor landing. They looked back, stepping aside to make room for Nancy. Jhansi looked over her shoulder. Half the escalator stretched out beneath her. Sebastian’s eyes had never looked so wide. The red endling hurtled forward, two short paces from the bottom of the escalator.
Sebastian yelled, “I can’t take him!”
Oren reached the landing. The red endling reached stepped onto the escalator. Binyelum grabbed Oren’s hand. Oren’s headphones pulsed, then dimmed. Binyelum disappeared. A screeching pinch harmonic exploded in Jhanis’s ears. A guitar cabinet appeared in midair behind the red endling. A distorted shockwave exploded from the cabinet. Binyelum reappeared, rocketing down toward the endling. The cab disappeared. The monster turned, its face a mask of fury. It raised a claw, reaching to strike, but too late. Binyelum’s machete sank in deep between the endling’s eyes. Killcolors flashed. Binyelum’s killchime sounded as they smashed into the endling’s body, knocking it back down onto the escalator.
Holy shit.
Binyelum stood and pulled their machete from the corpse. White stuff pumped from the wound. Binyelum knelt, deftly pushed their hand into the endling’s skull, and retrieved a memory card.
They looked up and said, “Keep moving.”
Across the food court, two blue endlings in black uniforms pursued the other teenagers up the escalator. Dr. Chef took up the rear, with Scuba Scooper ahead of them. They both paused and turned.
Dr. Chef lifted their surgeon’s mask, reaching their free hand out behind them. Scuba Scooper grabbed it. Their diver’s mask pulsed and dimmed. Dr. Chef retched. They vomited up a spray of turquoise light. It fountained out of their mouth, spreading through the air. Gravity began to take hold and the light froze, solidifying, holding its shape in midair, nebulite luminescence winking off the glowing, delicately angled edges.
Both blue endlings writhed in the substance, struggling to pull themselves free. The substance had caught the closer endling fully around the top of its torso and the bottom of its skull. The tips of its tusks peeked out. Could it breathe? Its manically wide eyes and desperate attempts to smash away the substance seemed to answer that question. The other endling had attempted to dodge away to the left, but the widening spray of the substance had caught it fully in the face and along its right shoulder. The stream had solidified before engulfing the endling, leaving its back exposed, but that didn't seem to matter, the monster still couldn't pull free.
All the teenagers threw themselves up their respective escalators.
Jhansi reached the landing. Sebastian and Binyelum pushed past her. Binyelum handed over the memory card without a word. A shaft of static stabbed into Jhansi's interior space, momentarily pushing her toward the back, but adrenaline and terror pulled her forward. She stuffed the memory card into her canvas bag.
Across the food court, two red endlings–one in a slate gray uniform and one in a black uniform–circled from different directions toward the other group of teenagers.
Twenty feet away, two blue endlings in different colored uniforms swung wildly at each other.
The sound of Oren’s gift had pulled some attention, but not as much as Jhansi would have guessed. Fair, when distraction meant death. The green endling looked toward the Asterlings, then toward the other group of teenagers. It snarled, then screamed. It hunched forward, spread both claws, and stalked toward the other teens.
Bineylum yelled, “Fucking pejudo!”
They turned.
“Oren. Velocity. Get Nancy and me. Push us forward.”
Velocity looked once toward the other group of teenagers. They seemed to contemplate something. Jhansi couldn’t understand their expression at all.
They turned to Oren and grabbed his wrist. Oren looked toward Binyelum and Nancy. Velocity’s helmet pulsed and dimmed. Oren’s headphones, which had regained their intensity, did likewise. Oren’s eyes flashed a glaring lime green. Binyelum, Nancy, and the other group of teenagers lit up in the same color. All of them disappeared. A chorus of pinch harmonics filled the space. Guitar cabinets of different models appeared in midair behind each of the nearest blue endlings. Across the food court, three cabs appeared in midair behind the two red endlings closest to the other teens. Two of them appeared above the endling in the black uniform, the third above the other. Noise exploded as all five teenagers reappeared, rocketing down toward their targets.
Both blue endlings turned with arms swinging.
Binyelum held their machete with both hands and slashed at their target’s wide claws. The blade sank deep into the structure of the claws. The attack altered Bineylum’s momentum. They swung around the monster’s arm. Their back smashed into its chest. Both toppled to the ground. The endling heaved and barked.
It reached up with its free arm and brought it down, stabbing all its claws deep into Binyelum’s chest, puncturing their heart and killing them instantly.
Wait, what the fuck?
That didn’t happen.
Before the strike could land, Binyelum tilted their head and–still holding their machete with both hands, the blade still embedded in the endling’s claws and pointed downward–pulled their machete, flashing killcolors, down into their enemy’s throat.
Holy fucking shit.
A killchime sounded. Blood and stuff fountained. The endling’s strike landed against the hand stuck to the machete.
Binyelum pushed themselves up and took off running toward the green endling.
Nancy’s eyes bulged, her grimace manic. Her knuckles whitened against the haft of her ax. She hurdled it through the air. It carved a sharp, killcolored semicircle. The blade smashed into the skull of her target. A killchime sounded. Blood and bone exploded. A smashed eyeball fell to the ground. The endling collapsed backward. Nancy collided with the falling body, threw herself to her feet, and wrenched her ax from the corpse’s destroyed skull. Stuff erupted from the mess.
Across the food court the two red endlings had reacted to the noise, but with less certain counter measures. Both spun around, sweeping the air with their claws. Neither knew to look up.
Scuba Scooper and Dr. Chef had appeared above the red endling in the black uniform. They tumbled through the air. Scuba Scooper managed to bring their spear-headed shovel plunging down into the endling’s back, just below its shoulder blade. The monster stumbled. Dr. Chef collided bodily with its other shoulder and fell to the floor. Their eyes flashed as they pushed themselves to their feet, one arm reaching up, the other rising to greet it, both hands holding tight to their killcolored knife. It sank deep into the endling’s throat. A killchime sounded. Blood and stuff sprayed Dr. Chef’s face. The monster slumped forward, held upright by Dr. Chef. They pulled their knife free and let the corpse fall onto glass.
Whack-a-knight brought their sledgehammer down as hard as possible toward their targeted endling’s skull, but misjudged the monster’s momentum. The head of the hammer shattered the endling’s collar bone. The monster barked, buckled to one knee, then turned to grab at the teenager, claws swiping wide. Whack-a-knight spilled clumsily off the endling’s shoulders. The strike caught their right side, knocking them to the ground. Red blood gushed from five deep claw wounds. The teenager screamed.
Velocity turned to Sebastian.
“Hand!”
Sebastian looked at them.
Across the food court, the injured endling pushed itself to its feet.
Velocity repeated their command.
“Hand!”
Sebastian reached out his left hand with a wary scowl.
Scuba Scooper and Dr. Chef rushed toward their friend.
Velocity grabbed Sebastian’s wrist. A moment later Velocity’s dimmed helmet regained its intensity. It pulsed and dimmed again. Sebastian’s flower crown did likewise. His eyes flashed that bright, flat lime green. Every special one in his field of vision lit up in the same color. Gold light flared from Whack-a-knight’s split flesh. The teenager’s erratic body language betrayed their confusion. The red endling loomed.
Scuba Scooper grabbed Dr. Chef’s hand again. They lifted up their surgical mask and vomited up another streak of turquoise light. The blast passed inches above Whack-a-knight and reached just far enough to catch the red endling in the chest, locking it in place. The monster snarled. It struck out, flailing and grasping with both arms, their claws cutting the air inches from Whack-a-knight’s head. The teenager pushed themselves up and away. The endling roared, pushing its jaw wide. Whack-a-knight gripped their sledgehammer with both hands and planted their feet. They brought their weapon through a wide horizontal arc squarely into their enemy’s jaw. Bone splintered. Orange blood sprayed. The shattered appendage tore free from the endling’s face, but not entirely. Skin and sinew held it dangling in place. The endling howled, spraying more blood.
Whack-a-knight grabbed Dr. Chef’s wrist, swung them around to face the endling, and shouted something. Their knight’s helm pulsed and dimmed. Dr. Chef’s body struck an uncannily rigid T-pose, their free hand aimed directly at the endling’s open mouth. Their knife shot from their grasp. It flashed killcolors, punching into the monster’s destroyed mouth and piercing through the back of its skull with another killchime. The weapon lost momentum, but instead of falling to the ground it pivoted in the air and charged back toward its owner, threading the opening it had just created. Dr. Chef grabbed it out of the air. The entire knife flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors. Jhansi blinked. The blade extended further than before, now as long as Binyelum’s machete, with an appearance like Damascus steel.
The endling’s corpse slumped forward, but remained held upright by the restraining substance. Dr. Chef reached between the monster’s jaws. Fatty matter squelched out as they retrieved the memory card. They crushed it, lifted up the bottom of their mask, stuck out their tongue, and pushed the memory card into their mouth.
The group fell back into formation. They sprinted toward the green endling, which continued stalking toward them, its prehensile appendage snapping threateningly. A group of endlings in slate gray uniforms separated the teens from their target.
Oren, Velocity, and Sebastian hurried to catch up with Binyelum and Nancy. Jhansi ran after them, clutching her fire extinguisher. She passed by the corpses that Binyelum and Nancy had made. The sight and sound of Oren’s gift flashed in her mind. How the fuck could she possibly contribute in a situation like this?
She blinked.
Memory cards.
Stupid bitch.
Jhansi turned. She hurried to the body Binyelum had left, dropping to her knees, banging them on the glass. The river below swelled, filling her vision. Vertigo seized her senses. She swooned and toppled forward, catching herself on the glass. She squeezed her eyes shut. Colors danced. She pulled a deep, ragged breath into her lungs. The sounds of violence surrounded her. She opened her eyes. A blue endling stood directly above her.
How?
Why?
The monster towered, bigger than anything Jhansi had ever seen. She could do nothing to stop it. Death shrieked at her, a sensory constant, the only feeling that mattered. Dark walls crushed her interior space, pushing her far into the back, reducing her entire world to the sparkling pinpoints of light sliding along claws and tusks and teeth. Jhansi’s mouth hung open. Maybe sound came out. Jhansi couldn’t hear anything over the roar of her demise. Her eyes burned. Her body went numb. She fell back. Claws descended. The end came. Her skull gave way, brains splattering out, eyes popping from their sockets, blood gushing up from the stump of her throat. She wet herself.
The river beneath the glass stretched on forever.
Just a stupid little girl after all.
Nothing special about her.
An explosion of noise reached Jhansi from what felt like a thousand miles away.
A flash split the endling’s uniform. Something erupted from its heart. Orange blood sprayed. A killchime sounded. The darkly grasping claws faltered, passing across Jhanis’s vision as they fell away. One brushed against her cheek, drawing a thin line. She didn’t feel it. She stared with manic eyes at the gold blade protruding from the monster’s breast. The blade retreated. The corpse fell forward. Jhansi pushed herself out of its way.
Each of Bineylum’s eyes glittered like the moon. Their teeth could eat planets. They knelt, holding her shoulder with a hand that could shape stars.
“Princess.”
Tears welled in Jhansi’s eyes.
Bineylum stood. Jhansi reached out, wanting to call them back down. They ignored her hand, stepping over her body toward a blue endling in a black uniform stepping off the escalator. Jhansi watched, transfixed, as Binyelum anticipated its attack, ducked beneath wide swinging claws, and drove their killcolored machete into the monster’s throat, pulling hard to the side, bringing forth a fountain of blood. A killchime rang out. Binyelum looked back at Jhansi, said nothing, and took off running toward the green endling.
Jhansi blinked.
Alive.
Her whole body shook.
Alive.
Her head hadn’t exploded. The monster hadn’t reduced her to a disgusting pile of slush. She hadn’t ended the night as a pathetic, humiliated loser.
Alive.
Binyelum had saved her.
She had to repay them.
How?
Memory cards.
Jhansi scrambled onto her knees. She climbed onto the back of the endling that had almost ended her life. Orange blood marked the gash left by Binyelum’s weapon. Jhansi plunged her arm in deep. Soaking warmth swallowed her up. Stuff pumped out in spurts as Jhansi searched deeper. Her hand found something hard. She grabbed it and yanked. Stuff stuck to her arm, slopping onto the floor as she stood. She shook it off.
Jhansi held up the memory card, only for a moment, and looked through it. The translucent body filtered out the color of the world. Jhansi watched violence rendered in shades of muted digital green and gray. Vibrant snapshot images flashed inside the card as it tilted in her grasp. She couldn’t understand any of them. She stuffed the card into her canvas bag.
Jhansi knelt, braced herself, and pushed with all her might against the corpse. It had fallen directly onto the first she had meant to loot, blocking her access to that memory card. The body shifted. Barely.
Jhansi exhaled.
Fuck.
She whirled and threw herself onto the corpse that Nancy had made.
Across the food court, the first streak of turquoise substance flickered and vanished, releasing the two endlings it held. Their bodies fell to the floor, suffocated. A red endling in a slate gray uniform clawed over the corpses and stalked up the escalator.
A loose semicircle of six blue endlings in slate gray uniforms closed in around the other group of teenagers. Dr. Chef jammed their knife into their belt and grabbed Scuba Scooper’s wrist with both hands. Whack-a-knight turned, bracing themselves against Dr. Chef’s back.
Dr. Chef’s mask pulsed and dimmed. A powerful sine wave burst from beneath Scuba Scooper’s feet, rippling the glass floor. Dr. Chef and Whack-a-knight stumbled, then pressed together harder. Neither fell.
The wave spread, cresting higher as it surged. Nebulite luminescence refracted wildly through the distorted glass. The wave hit the four closest endlings hard enough to throw them through the air. One crashed into another, claws tangling and orange blood spraying as they both went down. Another landed on its neck with a loud snap. Its body convulsed. The other two hit the floor at a distance, dazed but unharmed. The wave dissipated before reaching the endlings at the edges of the formation.
Whack-a-knight pushed themselves between both other teenagers. They reached into a pocket, grabbed something, pushed up their helmet, and popped the something into their mouth. Dr. Chef grabbed one of their wrists, Scuba Scooper the other. Whack-a-knight tensed. Their knight’s helm pulsed and dimmed. Both other teenagers struck rigid T-poses, their swords pointing toward each of the blue endlings remaining upright. The spear-headed shovel and elongated chef’s knife shot forward, though with less force than Jhansi had seen before. Both weapons flashed killcolors and pierced their targets with a killchime, but neither carved through, remaining stuck in their respective corpses.
The teenagers raced in unison toward the corpse embedded with the chef’s knife. The dazed endlings pushed themselves to their feet. The red endling on the escalator reached the second floor landing. The green endling hurtled itself toward the teens with a triumphant roar. Nancy and Oren pushed past three converging blue endlings. Velocity and Sebastian took one down with a coordinated strike. Binyelum's oxfords pounded the glass as they rushed to catch up. Jhansi pulled a memory card free from another endling’s corpse.
The railing across the food court exploded.
Glass and metal shrapnel blossomed, twinkling, hanging suspended in air as a massive shape emerged, rising as though in slow motion.
The enormous quadruped cleared the glass shelf and landed on its forepaws. The impact reverberated in Jhansi's teeth. The glass groaned. Jhansi’s stomach tightened. A moaning howl resounded from deep within the alterling’s throat, calling prey inward. Goosebumps pricked Jhansi’s flesh.
The alterling’s head had a protracted cylindrical shape, divided into three tightly packed sections. It had no sensory organs to speak of. Just a mouth. The skin around that wide hole pulled back, showing rows of teeth receding into darkness. A slender tongue flicked out. The howl continued. The monster’s long, leathery tail whipped through the air, smashing away more of the railing. A coat of rigid quills bristled across its entire body. It reared on its hind legs, to a height near four meters, and came smashing down again onto the glass.
Velocity shouted, “Fucking cursed tardigrade.”
The two endlings nearest Velocity and Sebastian looked at each other with trembling eyes, then fled into the peripheral darkness.
A squelching percussion and a deranged, gurgling scream pulled Jhansi’s attention.
Behind her, on the first floor, a red endling gave up its life to another altering.
This monster stood tall on two clawed raptor hindlimbs, its spherical body nearly clearing the second floor. Interlocking plates of dark bone covered the flesh of the body. From between them oozed a blue, translucent gel, dripping steadily in viscous strands to splatter on the floor. A meaty, tubular appendage hung between the alterling’s legs, pounding at the floor and sucking incessantly at the pooling goo, dragging a thin tongue along behind it.
Disgusting.
The red endling lay supine and squealing, impaled beneath one of the alterling’s feet, flailing desperately. It smashed its arms against the floor, its adversary, itself. The pool of blue goo foamed around its legs, dissolving them into a slurry. Grotesque bubbles drifted lazily into the air. The alterling’s snout slurped up the mess. The monster leaned forward, the orb of its body slowly eclipsing what remained of the red endling, releasing more gluey liquid onto its meal. The screaming stopped. The pounding snout sucked it all down.
Holy fuck.
Jhansi retched.
Sebastian chuckled darkly.
“Baba Yagoo.”
Jhansi whirled, glaring.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Sebastian gave her a look.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Baba Yagoo’s body flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors. A fresh wave of goo gushed onto the floor. It flowed more freely, the texture of it changed.
Across the food court, the cursed tardigrade tensed, raised its bristles, and struck with its tail, catching all three other teenagers with a single attack. Dr. Chef and Whack-a-knight had turned; they took it squarely in the stomach. Scuba Scooper took it in the back. All three teenagers battered the floor, their heads bouncing off the glass. Scuba Scooper’s diving mask shattered. Jhansi gasped.
The green endling rushed into the opening, reared back, and threw itself onto all fours, whipping its prehensile appendage forward with searing momentum. The alterling shifted, catching the strike with its left shoulder. The claw sunk deep. Orange blood spurted. The alterling grunted, shifted again, and charged. The green endling retracted its prehensile appendage, ripping flesh as it dragged its claw free, and launched its body to the side, deftly dodging the oncoming enemy.
The cylinder of the alterling’s mouth turned in midair. The skin around the opening pulled back again. The orifice widened horrifically. With a series of sinewy snaps, the entire organ thrust forward. The space between the first two cylindrical sections elongated, the skin stretched tight enough to expose bulging veins. Terror sparkled in the green endling’s eyes even before it hit the floor.
The alterling’s mouth swallowed the green endling down to its waist. The circle of teeth closed, trapping the endling’s prehensile appendage at an odd angle, severing the claw free. Orange blood sprayed.
Muffled screams filled the alterling's maw. The endling writhed, trying to attack from within. The alterling turned, dragging the endling, building momentum, then swung its head back in a semicircular arc, lifting up its prey and smashing it against the glass. Something in the endling's body cracked. Its legs twitched and splayed at disturbing angles. It screamed again, louder than before.
The alterling shuddered. The middle cylinder of its mouth constricted. The screaming rose in pitch. The alterling’s mouth squeezed harder. And harder. The screaming reached a frenzied peak. The resistance of flesh and bone gave way. The endling’s head yielded with a grinding crush. A stream of orange blood and viscera spilled from between the alterling's teeth, splashing down the endling’s limp body.
The alterling shuddered again. All three cylinders of its mouth started working in tandem, pulling apart the corpse and feeding it into the monster’s stomach. Blood and stuff dribbled as it fed.
Jhansi retched.
Binyelum shouted something as they blurred across the glass.
The cursed tardigrade’s body flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors. Three large hooked fangs appeared at even intervals around the radius of its maw. A spear of bone protruded from its tail, mirroring the now reinforced density of its quills.  
Binyelum shouted again, this time with church bell resonance, Velocity’s name and then Oren’s.
The altering grunted, turning its attention to the three incapacitated teenagers. Whack-a-knight had rolled over and pushed themselves up onto all fours. Dr. Chef still lay struggling to catch their wind. Scuba Scooper looked unconscious. Red blood oozed from the quills embedded deep in each of their torsos.
Oren turned.
The sound of the other teenager’s shrill cries filled Jhansi’s head. She saw them twitch and jerk helplessly in the throes of death, their instincts driving their terrified bodies to put up embarrassing, futile resistance against the monster eating them alive. The alterling would flash those strange colors, grow more powerful in ways Jhansi could only imagine, and lurch toward the Asterlings without hesitation.
Oren grabbed Velocity’s outstretched hand. The cursed tardigrade lunged. Velocity shared their gift with Oren.
Oren’s eyes flashed green. Binyelum, Nancy, and the three other teenagers lit up. They all disappeared. Five guitar cabinets appeared in midair above the cursed tardigrade. The monster’s barbed tail stabbed upward. A detonation chorus thundered. The teenagers emerged from the hovering cabs. The driving bone spike glistened. It obliterated the distance to Binyelum’s heart.
Binyelum grabbed the nearest hand they could find.
They plummeted, their grin tracing a blinding comet trail through space.
Their eyes burned white hot.
Their fox ear headband pulsed and dimmed.
They shouted, “Die like a–”
Their mouth moved, finishing the sentence, but Jhansi couldn’t hear the word.
Binyelum had grabbed Dr. Chef’s hand. Dr. Chef’s free arm detonated. They screamed. Red blood and viscera splattered outward. A shape emerged from the ruined limb. Two bright eyes. A jagged grin. A long, pointed snout. Ears.
A tremendous, leering fox head glittered, blood-soaked and golden. It shook itself. Its pupils whirled. It looked ravenous. It opened its mouth painfully wide.
The long blade of a claymore surged out from the fox’s throat.
It sang as it cut the air, severing the cursed tardigrade in half, smashing through the glass shelf, showering the arena with blood and gore and shimmering shrapnel.
Binyelum, Nancy, the three other teenagers, and the corpse of the cursed tardigrade crashed down onto the bottom floor. The glass shuddered. Everyone tumbled off the alterling’s body, down into a growing pool of viscera. Whack-a-knight ran to Scuba Scooper, rolled them over, checked their pulse, and slapped their cheeks firmly. Dr. Chef groaned, gripping the stump of their arm. Binyelum stood. They stared into the center of the food court. Their headband lit back up. Nancy stepped alongside them and they grabbed her wrist.
Jhansi followed Binyelum’s gaze. Standing directly beneath her, crouching slighly under the second floor glass shelf, Baba Yagoo clawed at the floor, its snout slurping up two more slurried corpses. Its body flashed a kaledoscopic grid of discordant colors, but from this angle Jhansi couldn’t see the resulting changes.
All the endlings had fled.
Baba Yagoo bobbed its head lightly, almost cutely, watching the teenagers standing against it. Binyelum and Nancy held hands and stared back. They both took a step forward.
Binyelum called, “Sebastian!”
Sebastian blinked. He looked away from Baba Yagoo, toward the other group of teenagers. Realization dawned.
The sound of his footsteps on the glass pulled Baba Yagoo’s attention. The monster shifted, the orb of its body craning. It followed Sebastian until he reached the escalator, then craned back toward Jhansi.
Jhansi stared downward. The plates of bone that protected the alterling’s body interlocked in intricate patterns, the space between them nearly imperceptible. Jhansi could only just make out the pink surface of the monster’s flesh. Raw and blistered.
Sebastian stepped off the escalator. Baba Yagoo turned to face him again. It looked toward the far end of the food court. At what, Jhansi couldn’t tell. The alterling stood for another short moment, then seemed to reach some calculated conclusion. It backed away from the teenagers, its snout still pounding at the floor and sucking at its own goo. Jhansi watched it retreat. It turned when it reached the edge of the food court and did not look back.
Binyelum let out a long sigh that turned into a laugh.
“Pejudo lo anmo.”
They let go of Nancy’s hand.
A tightness in Jhansi’s chest loosened.
Binyelum looked up through the glass and waved down the rest of the Asterlings. Jhansi jogged after Oren and Velocity. She reached into her canvas bag to count the memory cards she’d collected. Orange blood and stuff coated her arms, staining her clothes. A pool of it had accumulated in the bottom of the bag, where five cards clattered against each other.
She just needed one more to earn her new title.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked around for another corpse. Her eyes fell on Scuba Scooper’s shovel. It protruded upward at an angle from the chest of a blue endling. Jhansi changed direction. The endling’s empty eyes watched her approach. She set down her fire extinguisher and pulled on the shovel’s handle. Orange blood oozed from the wound, but the shovel remained inert. Jhansi huffed, placed a foot against the dead body, and pulled with all her strength. The shovel slid free, scraping against splintered ribs and setting Jhansi’s teeth on edge. Jhansi stared at the sword. The edges of the blade looked deliberately sharpened. She thought about touching them, and then remembered the endling’s claw back in the kitchen of The Rescue.
A beam of golden light flared beneath her. Sebastian had fixed Dr. Chef’s arm. The teenager panted. They flexed their regenerated limb, stretching their fingers and squeezing them into a fist. They looked around. Probably for their knife. Had they managed to collect it before the cursed tardigrade had appeared? Jhansi looked at the other nearby corpses. Nothing caught her attention. She picked up her fire extinguisher and stepped toward the shattered edge of the glass shelf. A sinister web of cracks traced outward in a radius from the edge of the destruction. Jhansi kept her distance and peered over the edge. There. On the other side of the cursed tardigrade’s corpse, where Dr. Chef couldn’t see it.
Jhansi hurried over to the escalator. Her fire extinguisher banged loudly against Scuba Scooper’s shovel. The sound pulled everyone’s attention, except for Sebastian, who knelt and shared his gift with the unconscious Scuba Scooper. Golden light beamed from their cuts, from their bleeding forehead, and from somewhere behind their eyes. They groaned. Sebastian helped them slowly sit up.
Jhansi reached the bottom of the escalator. Oren and Velocity stood over Dr. Chef, who sat staring back up at them. Sebastian let go of Scuba Scooper and stood, looming. Nancy stood across from Whack-a-knight, balancing her ax across her shoulders. Binyelum kept their attention on everyone as they reached into one half of the cursed tardigrade’s corpse. Nobody spoke. Jhansi didn’t understand the tension at all.
Jhansi walked around to the other side of the alterling’s body.
Binyelum called, “Jhansi, what are you doing?”
“Hang on a sec, I’ll be right there!”
Jhansi retrieved the knife. The Damascus pattern of the blade rippled in the nebulite. Jhansi fumbled with everything for a moment, then stuffed her fire extinguisher into her canvas bag. She hurried back and, holding the knife delicately by the blade, offered Dr. Chef their sword. Oren and Velocity both reached for her, their faces etched with sudden fury. Jhansi looked at them, confused. A searing line of pain ripped across her palm. She screamed. Scuba Scooper’s shovel hit the floor. A fist grabbed Jhansi’s hair. The world spun. Jhansi stumbled but couldn’t fall. The fist pulled. It fucking hurt. The spinning stopped. Jhansi stood panting, her head held at an awkward angle, staring at Oren and Velocity’s horrified expressions. The cold edge of a blade pressed against her neck.
Dr. Chef said, “Give us that fucking memory card.”
Bineylum stepped back from the corpse of the cursed tardigrade. A memory card glinted in their right hand. They stared at it for a moment, frowning, then shook it. Orange blood rained. Binyelum stared at the card again, then turned. Their eyes rover over Jhansi, Dr. Chef, and everyone else. They looked back at Jhansi. She couldn’t understand their expression at all.
Binyelum sighed.
“This hasn’t taught you anything, has it?”
The fist in Jhansi’s hair tightened and the knife pressed harder against her neck.
Dr. Chef repeated, “Give us that fucking memory card.”
Binyelum’s eyes shifted slightly. Their expression hardened in a way Jhansi hadn’t yet seen. Every counter of their face looked like a weapon. Jhansi’s pulse quickened. She swallowed, nicking a small cut in her neck. Her left hand throbbed.
Bineylum said, “You’re really going to become a kidkiller over–”
They casually tossed the memory card into the air. It flashed, flipping end over end. Dr. Chef sucked in a breath. The knife momentarily pulled away from Jhansi’s neck. Binyelum caught the card. Dr. Chef exhaled.
“–this?”
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
“You’re after the memory.”
They looked toward Whack-a-knight, then Scuba Scooper.
“Are you missing someone?”
Dr. Chef hissed, “You’re gonna be missing someone if you don’t hand over that memory card.”
Bineylum sighed again.
“Just tell me what you’re looking for. I’ll look for it in the memory.”
“Fuck you.”
Binyelum rolled their eyes.
“I’m trying to help you.”
“Sure thing. Prove it. Give me the fucking memory card. Tell me what you are looking for, and I’ll look for it in the memory.”
Binyelum blinked.
“I’m not looking for anything.”
“Bullshit.”
Binyelum shrugged.
Dr. Chef reiterated, “Bullshit.”
They added, “You really expect me to believe you’re here just for fun?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No way. Final Hand initiation.”
Dr. Chef spat, “Fuck you. Final Hand doesn’t do initiations.”
Binyelum chuckled.
“So you’re not a complete idiot.”
The knife pressed hard into Jhansi’s neck.
“Quit fucking around. Give. Me. The. Fucking. Memory card. Or your girlfriend is a ghost.”
Girlfriend?!
Jhansi’s heart pounded. Her face flushed. Hot tears of embarrassment pricked her eyes, threatening to spill.
What a pathetic fucking display. 
Crackling spikes of static stabbed into her interior space.
Binyelum watched her with a flat expression. They blinked. Their eyes flickered, gaze darting briefly and imperceptibly downward.
Looking away in disgust?
Jhansi's teeth ground together.
Stupid.
Binyelum didn't do that.
Jhansi replayed the moment over again in her mind. She watched Binyelum’s eyes. The movement looked so deliberate. Where had they looked? The canvas bag? The memory cards? Maybe they wanted to offer a trade?
Binyelum said, “I fucking love ghosts.”
They reeled back and whipped the memory card through the air with an overhand throw, hard enough that it whistled.
Okay, so, no trade.
Dr. Chef cursed.
“Pej!”
The fist released Jhansi's hair. The knife pulled away from her neck. Dr. Chef shoved her.
Ah.
Jhansi understood.
Dr. Chef reached for the memory card. Jhansi gripped the handles of the canvas bag, planted her feet, and swung around as hard as she could. The world blurred. Other figures moved across her vision, but she didn’t know to what ends. Jhansi kept her eyes focused on the arc of the bag.
Dr. Chef snatched the memory card out of the air. They turned. Jhansi's canvas bag, with the fire extinguisher and memory cards inside, smashed into their face. The memory cards inside the bag shattered audibly.
Welp.
Dr. Chef cursed. They stumbled. They still held tight to the cursed tardigrade’s memory card.
Fuck.
Oren appeared in a rush. He grabbed hold of the memory card and kicked Dr. Chef in the chest. Dr. Chef’s stumble turned into a fall. They landed in a pool of orange blood, their surgical mask painted with a growing stain of their own red blood.
A metallic impact split the air. Jhansi whirled. Whack-a-knight had swung on Nancy, who had caught and deflected the strike with the long haft of her ax. Whack-a-knight recovered from the ricochet, and didn’t swing again. Nancy’s bared teeth glinted in the nebulite.
Dr. Chef spat through their surgical mask.
“Fucking pejudo.”
Jhansi’s heart pounded in her chest. She panted. She stared at the curve of Dr. Chef’s forehead, her fingers tightening on the handles of the canvas bag. A dark shape swelled from the bottom of her interior space.
The dark shape said, {“Hurt them.”}
She squeezed the handles of the canvas bag.
Binyelum stared at her.
She turned, startled, then blushed and looked away.
Dr. Chef brought a hand to their nose and winced.
“Fucking–”
They paused.
“–people just don’t love anymore!”
Ooh.
It made sense now.
Binyelum stepped forward.
Dr. Chef looked up at them.
“Why are you like this?”
Binyelum chuckled dryly.
“Playing nice as a last resort.”
They hadn’t said it as a question.
Dr. Chef didn’t reply.
Binyelum looked at Oren.
“You’re the best.”
They took the memory card.
Dr. Chef reached up and pleaded, “Wait.”
Binyelum gave them a look.
Dr. Chef sighed.
“Look, just. I’m looking for my sister. I was supposed to start tonight with her, but–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“She wasn’t where the daydreaming told you she would be.”
Dr. Chef blinked.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum nodded.
“What’s she look like?”
Sebastian made a noise.
“Seriously?”
Binyelum flashed him a look.
“Yes. And?”
Sebastian doubled down.
“And, if they’d have gotten the memory card first, there’s no way they’d have done the same for us. And, you’re still just going to give them what they want. And, they were going to kill Jhansi.”
Binyelum smiled unexpectedly.
“I thought you didn’t trust Jhansi.”
Sebastian blinked.
A reverberation echoed down from the north end of the mall.
Everyone turned toward the sound.
Jhansi’s chest tightened.
What the fuck now?
