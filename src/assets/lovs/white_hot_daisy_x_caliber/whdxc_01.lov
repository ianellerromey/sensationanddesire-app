The barrel of the other girl's mouth whirled through the void.
Light slid along the metal.
Stars sparkled behind her.
I still had a few operational exocams, I got to watch her dance from different angles.
Colored vectors outlined calculated velocities.
Proximity warnings flashed and blared.
Hehe!
Blinkies!
Noises!
Makes my brain tingly.
And the other girl looked so pretty! 👀😍
The sleek, sparkling bulk of her exoframe thundering in a silent arc through the void.
A hemisphere of blood and containment fluid leaked from where I had ripped off her right arm.
It shimmered in the void 💦✨
Spelling out some kinda message?
For me?
Telling me she’s having fun?
As much fun as I am? 😍🥹
Her exosuit preservation protocols blasted a searing caustic foam across the exposing fissure. Containment fluid hissed and bubbled. It yielded to chemical insistence and transformed to glass, fusing with her containment tank.
All this happened in the breadth of a firing synapse.
The other girl kicked her thrusters to correct her trajectory.
The whirling stopped.
The barrel of her mouth filled my visor cam.
At this point my handler switched off our neural connection.
Which was fine. I didn't blame her. She seemed like a sad lady–something to do with that pretty picture, I think–and she didn't need to watch the pathetic end to my existence.
Besides.
Like.
Fuck.
Oh fuck 😳
Oh holy fuck! 😖🥵
Like.
Fffuck!
What a fucking–
Hole 🤤
Squeeze out an angel of death for me 🥵
My thighs pressed together reflexively.
My hips bucked.
Something clicked in the recesses of the other girl's machinery.
I felt it through the void.
An answer to my prayer, I guess.
And in the next snapshot of experience.
A projectile would arrive.
Fired with enough kinetic force to penetrate the seventeen layers of my exosuit helm.
The tempered glass of my containment tank.
The fragile dome of my skull.
The soft, defenseless nest of my brain.
Fuck! 😵‍💫
That bullet’s gonna pulverize my brain into paste!
I could cry and kick and scream and beg–and only accomplish humiliating myself.
Fffuck 🥵
I could unleash the full potentiality of my will and power and it wouldn't mean anything!
That bullet knows what it wants and I can't do a fucking thing to stop it.
Hnghhhhhhh 🫠
It wants to change me to better suit its own narrative 😖😳🥵
Smearing me across a dark expanse of nothing.
Leaving the decapitated monument of my useless body to pirouette eternally through the void.
My degradation absolute.
My failure permanent.
A consummate waste of life.
F u c k 😳😍
That bullet's gonna humiliate me for all time!
That's what it was made for!
It's gonna use me to satisfy all its urges because I'm not strong or certain enough to outmatch the power of its will 😍🥵
My heart pounded.
My eyes widened.
My crotch fucking ached.
I leaned forward 👀
Give it to me.
Give it to me! 
Gimme what I want! 👅
Or worse.
Hehe.
Yes!
Give it to me even worse than I want it.
Push me down so much further than I ever thought a girl could go.
Make me hurt in ways I’ve never imagined.
Make me understand.
Make me regret.
Show me the way things truly are.
Show me exactly what you think of me 😖🥺
Loser.
Worse.
What can I do?
How can I make it hurt even more?
How can I make it worse?
Trying.
Ohhh fuck 🥵🥵🥵
If I tried right now?
To fight back?
To assert myself and resist this thing craving to change me?
Staring annihilation in the face and summoning the audacity to insist that I know better.
Silly girl!
Thinking I could make a difference from this position.
From any position.
Only to have this fucking bullet just completely disregard my effort.
And satisfy itself anyway.
Easily.
Without thought.
Without consideration for me in any way.
Oblivious to my resistance.
Because it was always meant to be this way.
Fated.
Romantic.
F U C K 😖😍🥵
That’s what I fucking want!
But what could I do?
What can I do?
No time to move a limb.
No time to kick a thruster.
Boop ✨
No time to think.
Act.
I focused all my sensory receptors on my visor cam.
And I mean all of them.
Staring into the barrel of the other girl's mouth.
Birthplace of my reaper bullet.
My entire world.
I opened wide.
My mouth, I mean.
Aaahhh 👅
The jaws of my exosuit unhinged.
Let's go! 💥
I smashed my fucking teeth together.
MONCH! 😁
A massive detonation shook the void.
The jaws of my exosuit crushed the barrel of the other girl's mouth.
The bullet struck.
Everything fucking exploded.
Fuck!
The seventeen layers of my exosuit helm disintegrated.
Yes!
The containment tank glass covering my face disintegrated.
Fuck!
The containment fluid around my head vaporized.
Yes!
An indescribable shockwave of pain ripped across my face.
Oh fuck!
My heart pounded.
My crotch ached.
I bucked my hips.
It hurt so bad.
It was so much worse than I expected! 😍🫠
I stared with blistered, unblinking eyes straight out into the frigid void.
Into the obliterated mess of the other girl's head.
Oh fuck.
Nothing remained but mist.
And that perfectly severed eyeball.
And.
A tooth?
She had teeth?
Where? 😳
Red blood and containment fluid pumped from the wet, gaping hole of her neck.
Her exosuit didn't try to patch the breach.
It wouldn't respond without a neural connection.
And really.
No need.
Because.
Wow.
Somehow.
I’d won?
Yes.
Yes!
I’d won!
Ahahahahaha! 😍👑💛
I fucking won!
Eat your goddamn fucking heart out!
Caustic foam splattered across my broken face.
Oh fuck!
Fuck!
Owieee 😭
I screamed.
Foam filled my mouth.
Disgusting 😭
Containment fluid sloshed forward and cauterized the foam into glass.
Which held my mouth forcibly open.
Embarrassing 😭
I stared through the glass into the void.
My handler reinitiated our neural connection.
Yay!
They came back!
I said, {“Caliber!”}
A long pause.
Caliber said, {“Daisy.”}
She paused.
{“You're alive.”}
