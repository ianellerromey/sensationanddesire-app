Encounter III
[1340 MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ 6.94% Luminosity

Partway through the seventeenth century, Swedish settlers arrived on the eastern coastline of the North American continent. They sailed south along the land inhabited by the Lenape people, eventually coming across a wide, recessed bay, its mouth protected by a long, narrow, rocky and uninhabitable island. They passed into the bay, continuing until they reached the furthest inland point of the bay’s triangular body, where the water flowed into a river that stretched further into the continent. They weighed anchor and established a colony.
Over several centuries, and through a storied history of violence, that colony grew into the port city of St. Alëmskaan’machi, the largest metropolitan area in the state of Delaware and one of the preeminent American economic hubs. An expansive port stretched along the southern edge of Goldbar Bay, opposite the industrial district to the north. Shipping traffic entered the bay through the passage south of the Portvaktens Palats, the barrier island, and exited via the northern passage.
The metal spires of the downtown district rose in a crowd near the Brightbird River estuary, and the rest of the city sprawled inland, divided by the river itself, with privileged neighborhoods stretching northward and working class neighborhoods relegated to the south. A series of eclectic, beloved bridges connected both halves of the city, most of them designed for automotive traffic, a handful exclusively for foot traffic.
The Bridgemall Commercial Park served a different purpose. A tied-arch design held aloft the two-story, one-hundred and fifty meter structure, which spanned the Brightbird River from north to south, about two miles inland from the estuary. Inside, shoppers could patronize any of the mall’s two-hundred trendy stores, or enjoy a meal at the food court, where two specially engineered glass floors, one connecting both mezzanines on the second floor and the other serving as the main walkway on the first floor, granted a nearly unobstructed view of the river more than fifty meters below.
Jhansi said, “I love Bridgemall!”
She paused, then added, “What’s at Bridgemall?”
Bineylum said, “We’re looking for someone.”
Right, Oren had said something about that.
Someone with a K name?
Jhansi asked, “What’s the deal with that? How do you know they’re supposed to be with you? How come they’re not?”
Binyelum dragged their fingers across the shifter.
“I know she’s supposed to be with us because I saw her in the daydreaming. We all saw each other, that’s part of how it works.”
Yet another anomaly in Jhansi’s experience.
Great.
Nebulites blinked into the cabin at uneven intervals.
Binyelum said, “I don’t know why she wasn’t close by when the netherlume shift started tonight.”
They paused, then added, “It worries me.”
Jhansi asked, “But she’s at Bridgemall?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No. But it looks like there’s probably an endling at Bridgemall who knows where she is.”
Jhansi blinked.
“You learned that from the memory card you crushed?”
Binyelum said, “We all learned it.”
Velocity bucked their legs, bouncing Jhansi.
“Didn’t you break a memory card too?”
Jhansi frowned.
She looked across at Oren, searching his face for support as she replied.
“Well. Yeah. I just–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“She has a hard time with the memories.”
Oren blinked at her.
Velocity made a small noise.
“Figures.”
Sebastian looked pained.
“And you’re still sure she’s not gonna fuck anything up?”
Jhansi said, “Hey!”
Binyelum shrugged.
“I prefer practice over theory.”
Sebastian made a face, pressing together his lips and bugging out his eyes.
Thorns of static began to grow in Jhansi’s interior space. She pushed them back down, hard, smashing their roots. It hurt, but it would hurt a lot more to lose control on Velocity’s lap.
She said, “What’s it like? Seeing a memory like that?”
Sebastian’s expression turned into a theatrical leer.
“I watched through an endling’s eyes as it ate a teenager’s head.”
Sebastian’s leer widened. His eyes went manic, and distant. He spoke breathlessly.
Jhansi swallowed.
Sebastian continued.
“I felt it. All of it. Not just the way their body twitched and squirmed in my grip, but the way I felt about it. I loved it. It felt so good, seeing them so helpless and pathetic and amusing. Their squealing resonated in my mouth. I could taste their tears and snot on my tongue. I salivated. And chewed. I felt designed for it. Just a little pressure and–”
Sebastian laughed.
“–their squealing pitched up like a fucking cartoon. It was so fucking funny! I couldn’t hold back. I bit down. Their skull gave way all at once, shattering and caving in. Brains squeezed into my mouth like fucking easy cheese. Their whole life spurted onto my tongue and I swallowed it down.”
What?
Jhansi said, “That’s–”
Sebastian kept going.
“They pissed and shit them–”
Nancy reached from the front seat and slapped Sebastian’s face.
He blinked. A spot of pink blossomed where Nancy had struck. He raised a hand and touched it. He swallowed.
“Sorry.”
Nancy stared at him with an indecipherable expression.
Jhansi blinked.
What the fuck?
She breathed hard, practically snorting through flared nostrils. Blood pounded in her ears. Her stomach felt hot and tight.
What the hell did this feeling mean?
For a moment nobody spoke.
At last Binyelum asked, “Did you get to see their gift?”
Sebastian shook their head.
“What?”
Binyelum expounded.
“That special one, they had a gift. Did you get to see them use it?”
Sebastian paused.
“Actually, yeah, I did.”
“Well, what was it?”
A vacant seafood market emerged from the cloak on their right. Somewhere behind its boarded up windows a nebulite emitted a soft blue glow. Orange blood dripped down the graffiti painted across its facade.
“Their gift was a mobility boost, a kind of jump, I guess? When they shared their gift they’d launch you forward and upward, pretty hard, without any kind of charge up at all, at a little less than a forty-five degree angle. You’d even get a little animated motion line afterimage. I watched them throw a special one with a pipe wrench straight into an endling’s face. The wrench smashed through the endling’s eye. It was a killswing.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s a pretty neat gift.”
Jhansi stared through Sebastian and tried to clear her thoughts.
Binyelum said, “It's probably going to be like that at Bridgemall.”
A massive pillar of white light erupted to the south, miles away but still clearly visible through the cloak. Everyone turned toward it. The light reached higher into the sky before breaking away from the ground and dissipating in pieces. Jhansi's stomach dropped.
She whispered, “Fuck.”
Binyelum said, “Yeah. That's pretty much what I mean.”
