Jhansi Aur - Encounter III
[1340 MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ 6.94% Luminosity

A group of Swedish settlers reached the eastern coastline of the North American continent partway through the seventeenth century, sighting land already inhabited by the Lenape people. The settlers sailed south before disembarking, eventually stumbling across a recessed bay with a long, rocky island protecting its wide mouth. They passed into the bay, following the coastline until they reached the furthest inland point, where the water flowed into a river reaching deeper into the continent.
The settlers weighed anchor and established a colony.
That colony grew–over several centuries of storied violence–into the port city of St. Alëmskaan’machi, the largest metropolitan area in the state of Delaware, and one of the preeminent hubs of American and international economics.
The city’s expansive port flourished along the southern edge of Goldbar Bay, opposite the industrial district to the north. Shipping traffic entered the bay south of the barrier island, the Portvaktens Palats, and exited via the northern passage. The metal spires of the downtown district rose in a crowd near the Clearway River estuary. The rest of the city sprawled inland from there, divided by the river, privileged neighborhoods stretching northward and working class neighborhoods to the south. A series of eclectic, beloved bridges connected both halves of the city, most designed for automotive traffic, a small handful exclusively for foot traffic.
The three-story, one-hundred and fifty meter structure of the Bridgemall Commercial Park spanned the Clearway River about two miles inland, held above the water by thick tied-arch beams. The space housed two-hundred trendy stores; an indoor ice skating rink near the south entrance; a multi-story climbing wall near the north entrance; and a central food court installed across all three stories. Covered bridges spaced at wide intervals connected the mezzanines on the second and third floors, a fractal mirror of the shape of the building. Large bulbous lights hung at varying lengths from the ceiling, some reaching all the way down to the first floor. Rings of fast food vending establishments encircled the central space of each floor, where concentric patterns of tables and chairs sat atop specially engineered glass panels, the view of the river below virtually unobstructed, visible from every floor. An overhead glass dome allowed sunlight to pierce through the entire building.
Jhansi clapped.
“I love Bridgemall!”
She paused.
“What’s at Bridgemall?”
Bineylum said, “We’re looking for someone.”
Right.
Oren had said something about that.
Someone with a K name?
Jhansi cocked her head.
“What’s the deal with that? How do you know they’re supposed to be with you? How come they’re not?”
Binyelum dragged their fingers across the shifter.
“I know she’s supposed to be with us because I saw her in the daydreaming.”
They paused.
“We all saw each other, that’s part of how it works.”
Great.
Another anomaly in Jhansi’s experience.
Commercial establishments and five-over-one apartments flashed past outside the window. 
Nebulites blinked overhead at uneven intervals.
Binyelum shrugged.
“I don’t know why she wasn’t close by when the netherlume shift started.”
They paused.
“It worries me.”
And the Asterlings found Jhansi instead.
Did Binyelum include that in their list of worries?
Jhansi frowned.
“This girl’s at Bridgemall?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“No.”
They gestured.
“It looks like there’s probably an endling at Bridgemall who knows where she is.”
Jhansi blinked.
“You learned that from the memory card you crushed?”
Binyelum nodded.
“All the endlings back there had the information.”
Velocity bucked their legs, bouncing Jhansi.
“Didn’t you break a memory card too?”
Jhansi frowned.
She looked across at Oren, searching his face for support.
“Well. Yeah. I just–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“She has a hard time with memories.”
Velocity huffed.
“Figures.”
Sebastian raised his eyebrows.
“And you’re sure she’s not gonna fuck this up?”
Jhansi said, “Hey!”
Binyelum shrugged.
“I’ll let you spank me when I’m wrong.”
Sebastian pressed together his lips and bugged out his eyes.
Thorns of static extruded slowly from the perimeter of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi smashed them back down.
It hurt, but it would hurt a lot more to lose control on Velocity’s lap.
Okay.
Maybe she could refocus the conversation.
“What’s it like? Seeing a memory like that?”
Sebastian leered theatrically, raised both hands like claws.
“I watched through an endling’s eyes as it ate a teenager’s head.”
Oh.
Wait.
Hang on.
Bad idea.
Jhansi raised her hands.
“Okay, point taken.”
Sebastian’s leer widened.
His eyes went slightly crossed.
He spoke breathlessly.
“I felt it. All of it.”
He looked at his hands.
“Not just the way their body twitched and squirmed in my grip, but–”
He looked straight at Jhansi.
“–the way it felt inside.”
The dark shape writhed outward from the shadows at the edge of Jhansi's interior space.
Fuck.
That thing again.
Sebastian’s leer turned to a grin.
“I loved it. It felt so good, seeing them so helpless. And pathetic. And amusing.”
Fuck.
The dark shape said, {“Amusing.”}
Fuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I get it!”
Sebastian continued.
“Their squealing resonated in my mouth. I could taste their tears and snot on my tongue. I salivated. I chewed. I could tell I had been designed for it. Just a little pressure and–”
Sebastian laughed.
“–their squealing pitched up like a fucking cartoon.”
The dark shape churned and swelled.
{“Yes.”}
Sebastian shook his head.
“It was so fucking funny! I couldn’t hold back. I bit down. Their skull shattered. Brains squeezed like fucking easy cheese into my mouth. Their whole life spurted into my throat and I swallowed it down.”
What.
The.
Fuck.
The dark shape panted.
Jhansi's hands shook.
“That’s–”
Sebastian kept going.
“They pissed and shit them–”
Nancy leaned forward from the front seat.
Sebastian shut up, somehow managing to furrow his brows and widen his eyes.
Nancy reached an index finger toward Sebastian's mouth.
Sebastian backed away slightly.
Nancy persisted.
She held her index finger an inch from Sebastian's lips.
She shook her head, pulling her features into an adorable and uncanny smile.
Sebastian blinked.
His cheeks went pink.
“Sorry.”
Nancy's expression fell back into indecipherable neutrality.
She stared at Sebastian.
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
Holy fuck.
She breathed hard, practically snorting through flared nostrils.
Blood pounded in her ears.
Her stomach felt hot and tight.
The dark shape stared at her.
She snarled at it.
{“Fuck off!”}
The dark shape shrugged.
What the hell did this mean?
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum looked at Sebastian in the rearview mirror.
“Did you get to see their gift?”
Sebastian blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum nodded.
“The special one you saw in your memory, they had a gift.”
Binyelum paused.
“Did you get to see them use it?”
Sebastian blinked again.
“Actually, yeah, I did.”
Binyelum gestured.
“What was it?”
A vacant seafood market emerged from the cloak on their right. An unlit neon fish gawped at Jhansi from above the gated glass doorway, eerily underlit by the diffuse baby blue nebulite glowing somewhere inside. Orange blood dripped down the graffiti painted across the facade of the building.
Sebastian said, “Their gift was a mobility boost. A kind of jump, I guess? It would launch someone forward and upward, at a little less than a forty-five degree angle. Pretty fast, without any kind of charge up. They’d even get a little animated motion line afterimage.”
He paused.
“I watched them throw a special one with a pipe wrench straight into an endling’s face.”
He paused again.
“The wrench smashed through the endling’s eye.”
Another pause.
“It was a killswing.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s a useful gift.”
Jhansi stared through Sebastian, trying to clear her thoughts.
Binyelum said, “Probably gonna be like that at Bridgemall.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi said, “What?”
The Asterlings had dispatched the endlings at The Rescue so easily.
But.
If they had lost.
Would it have ended like Sebastian had just described?
Jhansi’s stomach turned.
Jhansi shook her head.
“You guys took care of the endlings back there so easily.”
Sebastian frowned.
“Get out from behind your screen. It’s a very different experience.”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
Binyelum pulled Mambele into a parking lot.
Jhansi looked around.
They couldn’t have arrived at Bridgemall.
Not yet.
Jhansi hadn’t prepared herself at all.
Binyelum pulled the parking brake and left the engine running.
They opened their door, stepped into the night, and popped the seat forward.
Nancy left through her door, and Sebastian and Oren followed her.
Velocity raised their eyebrows at Jhansi.
“Come on, princess.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity gestured.
“Let’s get going.”
Jhansi blushed.
She hurried out of the car.
Velocity followed, leaving the door hanging open.
Jhansi looked around.
No nebulites.
Jhansi couldn’t see much, but still, this didn’t seem like Bridgemall.
“Where are we?”
Binyelum pointed upward.
“Washington Center.”
The Washington Center office campus consisted of an octagonal, thirteen-story tower and two adjoining rectangular buildings, one to the northwest with five stories, the other to the northeast with seven stories. Wide, glass-encased breezeways connected the bottom floors of the adjoining buildings to the central tower. The parking lot sprawled south of the campus, with a second and third level underground.
Binyelum had pointed up toward the top of the central tower.
Jhansi followed the gesture.
She couldn’t see shit.
“I can’t see shit.”
Binyelum laughed.
“Yeah.”
Oren said, “It’ll get easier to see through the cloak as the moon gets full.”
Oh wild.
Jhansi said, “Neat.”
She stopped craning her neck.
“Why are we here?”
Binyelum said, “We need to scout the route to Bridgemall.”
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
“Scout?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Do you know the safest way to Bridgemall?”
Well.
Jhansi thought for a second.
“I would head south from here until we reach one of the wider neighborhood avenues, and use one of those to get to the highway. From there–”
Sebastian interrupted.
“You’re sure there’s nothing waiting on the highway?”
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Sebastian blinked back at her.
“If I was a thirty-eight caliber alterling looking to pick off some dumb, easy special ones at the beginning of the netherlume shift, I’d lurk on the highways for sure.”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh fuck.”
Sebastian nodded.
“She begins to understand!”
Jhansi turned to Binyelum.
“How are you going to be able to scout anything in–”
She gestured around her.
“–this?”
Binyelum laughed.
“Probably not very well.”
They shrugged.
“But we have to try.”
Jhansi looked up again.
“Are there …”
She paused.
“… endlings up there?”
Sebastian adopted a cringing affectation.
“E-e-endlings?”
Jhansi shot him a look.
Binyelum shrugged.
“Won’t know ‘til we get there.”
Oh.
Jhansi looked at them.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum nodded.
“She begins to understand.”
Jhansi blinked.
She looked toward the base of the tower.
“What if it’s locked?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Oh no, we break a rule.”
What gives, asshole?
Jhansi turned and stared at him.
Binyelum said, “C’mon.”
They popped the trunk.
Everyone gathered close to retrieve their swords and masks.
Bineylum grabbed their machete, and a headband with a pair of fake fox ears fixed on top, the orange fur more vibrant a shade than Jhansi had ever seen.
Oren grabbed his chainlock and a pair of angular open back mixing headphones, stuffing the long cable down his shirt and tucking the tail of it into the pocket of his jeans.
Velocity grabbed their aluminum bat and an astronaut’s helmet, their face disappearing behind the reflective gold visor.
Sebastian grabbed his barbell and flower crown, pulling on the headpiece deliberately askew.
Nancy abstained from grabbing anything.
Hm.
Nancy had a whole deal, didn’t she?
Velocity flipped up the visor on their helmet in a vivid flash of makeup.
Jhansi grabbed her fire extinguisher and the canvas bag, and pulled down Mambele’s trunk.
The Asterlings turned toward the Washington Center Tower.
Jhansi hurried to catch up.
Something caught her eye.
Mambele's refresh had repaired the back of Binyelum’s jacket.
A purple rose outlined in gold crested like a rising moon, cut off halfway at the cropped hem of the jacket, encircled by text rendered in brilliant white.
TO: SOMEPLACE TO CALL YOUR OWN, FROM: WHICH TO TAKE A STAND
What an absolute bastard.
Jhansi again looked up toward the tower looming above.
Rows of empty windows stared impenetrably back, assessing her with unknowable scrutiny.
Like some predatory insect.
How inviting.
Jhansi turned to Oren.
“We didn’t scout the route between that 7-11 and The Rescue.”
Oren shrugged.
“It was early in the night. It’s …”
He paused.
“It’s hard to run into the wrong crowds when it's early.”
He paused again.
“Usually.”
Jhansi watched him.
He gestured.
“Besides, where would we have scouted from?”
Jhansi thought for a second.
“There’s that apartment building.”
Oren made a face.
“Ah, yeah.”
He nodded.
“That apartment building.”
He grinned.
“How specific.”
Jhansi stuck out her tongue.
“You know what I mean.”
Binyelum danced up the hemisphere of shallow stairs leading to the glass doors of the tower.
They paused.
“Hm.”
Everyone paused in turn.
Jhansi saw why.
One of the doors hung limp, barely connected by a single hinge.
Shattered glass lay all around.
Jhansi couldn't see the door’s push bar anywhere.
Velocity stepped forward.
“Well shit.”
Sebastian said, “Frosted and flakey.”
Binyelum toed the shards of glass.
“That's what these are.”
They looked into the dark interior of the tower lobby, then turned to face the Asterlings.
“Whoever came through was either very confident or very stupid.”
They paused.
“No care given to keeping their presence a secret, so, probably not an alterling.”
They absently scanned the empty parking lot.
“And probably not someone intent on sticking around.”
Oren said, “There's plenty of parking on the other side of the campus, and two more levels below this one.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Too much work.”
They turned back toward the smashed door.
“Nancy and Velocity, you go first.”
Oren made a face.
Binyelum noticed, and continued.
“Then Sebastian, Jhansi–”
They paused.
“Then Oren. I’ll take up the rear.”
Oren looked at Jhansi.
Wait.
What did she have to do with that?
Binyelum gestured into the building.
“There's gonna be a circular landing inside that ends with a short flight of stairs. Up those stairs, the second landing opens onto a hallway of elevators. Immediately to the right, before the elevators, there'll be a door leading to a stairwell.”
They nodded.
“We're gonna take that stairwell all the way up. Should be fine, as long as we’re slow and quiet.”
Fuck.
Jhansi swallowed.
She did not want to set foot in that building.
Her instincts screamed.
Return to Mambele.
Wait it out.
What difference would it make?
She’d probably just slow everyone down.
Nancy stepped over the shattered door and into the lobby.
How would it feel to watch everyone else disappear inside?
Fuck.
That.
Jhansi tightened her grip on her fire extinguisher, keeping close to Sebastian as he followed Velocity into the darkness.
Binyelum smiled at Jhansi as she passed.
She made a face.
The glass crunched beneath Jhansi’s flats.
The empty expanse of the lobby pulled at Jhansi.
Here goes.
Jhansi stepped over the broken door in a whirl, lifting her left foot, turning to place it inside the bent rectangle of the door, continuing the spin, placing her right foot inside with her, then repeating the motion, stepping out of the door and fully onto the landing inside the building.
She looked back.
Oren smiled as he stepped inside.
Binyelum followed.
The lobby looming around Jhansi.
The carpeted landing muffled the footsteps of the Asterlings as they moved up toward the second landing.
They passed two other flights of stairs, each on opposite sides of the landing, curving down to converge in a swampy darkness, presumably providing access to the underground parking garage.
Fuck.
Forget the highway.
That seemed as likely a place as any for endlings and alterlings to lurk.
The Asterlings crossed up onto the second landing and stepped lightly across the marble tiles. Each clack reverberated down the hallway.
The ceiling stretched further than Jhansi had expected, probably up past the second story of the tower. Not that it made much difference. Jhansi couldn’t see it. With the moon occluded, the cloak hung thicker than ever.
Jhansi squinted, searching down the hallway for anything at all for her eyes to catch on.
Elevators, staring across at each other like coffins.
Fucking great.
Nancy found the door Binyelum had mentioned.
Absent a handle.
Even better.
Nancy touched the splintered wood, shrugged to herself, and pulled.
The door swung outward.
The gloom beyond seemed even fucking worse.
Yay.
Nancy looked back.
Binyelum nodded.
Nancy disappeared through the doorway.
The rest of the Asterlings followed.
Jhansi’s visibility diminished to practically nothing.
She could barely see the back of Sebastian’s vest.
Resplendent.
The building’s architect had designed the stairwell with an octagonal shape, a mirror of the tower itself. The stairs spiraled upward around the edge of the octagon, traversing the full circumference once per floor. Tall, narrow windows, like arrowslits, opened onto the outside at regular intervals, allowing a laughably minimal amount of moonlight to filter inside.
The smack of feet on concrete echoed.
Jhansi went to mount the stairs, misjudged the distance, and stumbled awkwardly. She threw out her arms to catch herself. She caught the rail with her left hand. Her right forearm banged against the metal edge of something else.
She couldn't even see what.
“Fuck!”
Sebastian turned to glare at her.
Ugh.
He looked over Jhansi’s head, at Binyelum.
Binyelum shook their head and gestured him onward.
The Asterlings moved slowly.
Nancy held her ax ready.
Velocity kept their bat raised close behind.
Sebastian gripped his barbell.
Oren kept one of his hands free for Binyelum.
Binyelum backed up the stairs, searching the darkness below.
Jhansi counted stairs.
Six to a side of the octagon.
How many stairs would it take in total?
Five-hundred and something?
Velocity swore just as Jhansi stepped onto stair five-hundred and twenty.
“Pejudo.”
Everyone lurched to a halt.
Nancy stood one step beyond the landing of the twelfth floor, peering up past the final flight of stairs toward the ceiling of the stairwell. Velocity stood behind her on the landing. Both wore hard expressions.
Velocity said, “Welp.”
Binyelum called, “What?”
Sebastian stepped up to take a look.
His mouth flattened and his eyes went wide.
Jhansi's ears picked up a new sound.
A rhythmic, sinewy squelching, like a wet rope twisting tighter and tighter.
Then a louder snap.
Oh fuck.
Sebastian grimaced.
Nancy tightened her grip on her ax.
Velocity said, “Just come take a look.”
Binyelum pushed forward.
Fuck it.
Jhansi followed Binyelum.
Oren made a sound when Jhansi moved, but he didn't say anything.
Binyelum followed Nancy’s gaze.
“Ah.”
Jhansi craned forward.
A metal ladder stretched upward from the final landing, ending in a small platform leading into a narrow corridor. 
The white sole of a sneaker dangled in midair near the platform.
Fuck.
Jhansi took in the shape of the limp human body.
And then the unwelcome, dark topography of shapes clustered in the corner of the ceiling.
A monster.
An alterling.
The human body wore a pair of dark blue board shorts and a white button-down tee patterned with bright watermelon slices. The tee hung open, showing off the body’s tanned, hairless stomach. The body had no arms. Thick trails of blood stained both sides of the tee. Drops fell steadily from the hem, splashing into a pool on the landing.
The alterling had swallowed the body's head, and nearly half its torso.
The monster pulsed, shuddered, and pulled the body further inward.
The shape of its body had a geometric quality, something like a honeycomb.
Most of the cells held glistening mucous membranes, swollen and packed with dense patches of dark hair.
From the other cells dangled long, rough tendrils.
They curled and swayed, occasionally unfurling to stretch.
Hooked thorns grew at intervals along the length of each tendril, droplets of clear liquid beading near each point.
Two tendrils held tightly to the human body's waist, squeezing, supporting the weight.
Red blood dribbled from deep puncture wounds where the tendrils made contact with the human body's skin.
The cell at the center of the structure of the monster’s body had distended wide to receive the human body, crowding away the adjacent cells.
The membrane swelled, then clenched.
Snap.
Blood gushed from the holes in the human body.
It disappeared further into the monster.
What.
The.
Entire.
Fuck.
Binyelum said warmly, “Nice.”
Jhansi gave Binyelum a wild look.
“Excuse me?”
The words came out tight.
Binyelum looked at her.
They smiled.
Jhansi found their dark eyes unsearchable.
They turned back to face the monster.
“They’re doing it right.”
What the fuck?
Jhansi followed Binyelum’s gaze.
She stared at the feeding monster.
The dark shape said, {“They’re doing it right.”}
Jhansi’s mind went blank.
The world slipped out of focus.
Someone jostled against her.
She responded automatically, backing down the stairs.
Oren said, “Solo?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Probably not. Probably picked off from a band like ours. Last one in line on the way back down.”
Velocity said, “And nobody fucking noticed?”
Bineylum nodded.
“Seems like.”
Oh fuck.
Had the monster captured the teenager alive? 
Velocity said, “Nobody noticed the fucking beehive alterling in the corner of the stairwell?”
Sebastian said, “Rough day for Pooh Bear.”
Velocity talked over him.
“Nobody noticed when they got outside and a whole fucking member of their team was gone?”
Binyelum scratched their chin.
“Maybe they just didn’t wanna risk coming back.”
Velocity shook their head.
“Nice.”
Sebastian said, “Maybe they made a sacrifice.”
Everyone turned to look at him.
He shrugged.
“To keep the alterling busy.”
Nancy raised an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth tilting upward.
Bineylum said, “No wonder you don’t trust Jhansi.”
Sebastian made a face.
Jhansi kept staring at nothing.
How had it felt?
Had the Honey Pot lifted Pooh Bear bodily before ripping off both their arms, muscles stretching, resisting, yielding, tearing with percussive snaps, their body reconfigured to fit more conveniently into the monster’s feeding apparatus?
The dark shape roiled.
The Honey Pot would have needed to paralyze Pooh Bear first, to keep them from making noise.
Oren said, “Pejudo lo anmo.”
He ran a hand through his hair.
“It’s pretty much impossible to reach that thing from the landing.”
He looked at Binyelum.
“My gift can get you or Nancy up there. It’s an awkward spot, but–”
Binyelum interrupted.
“Dunno. Don’t really like those barbs.”
Oren frowned.
Binyelum continued.
“That secretion is at least paralytic.”
They paused.
“And probably poisonous.”
Jhansi nodded absently.
Exactly.
Pooh Bear had watched, drugged and immobilized, as the Honey Pot’s awful swelling mouth had engorged to accommodate their body, the folds of its membrane filling their vision, their entire world a salivating cavern.
Binyelum said, “It’ll probably leave us alone if we don’t fuck with it.”
Velocity stared.
“Really?”
Binyelum stared back.
Velocity said, “You’re just gonna leave it there?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Why not?”
Velocity made a face.
“Because it’s fucking eating someone, Binyelum.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yeah. It’s supposed to.”
They gestured.
“That’s how this works.”
Jhansi nodded again.
Correct.
Pooh Bear’s legs had kicked out in futile protest as the Honey Pot tightened its inexorable hold, further and further, cutting off their oxygen, crushing their windpipe, sending their mind into a black reeling panic as the end descended in one pitiful climax of utter despair.
And then the monster had snapped their neck.
The dark shape gurgled.
Jhansi’s stomach turned.
No.
Not again.
Fight it.
Jhansi swallowed.
She blinked.
Back to reality.
Sebastian said, “Sure it’s not gonna take a swipe at us while we’re climbing past?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Pretty sure.”
They raised their voice.
“Because then it would die.”
They shook their head.
“It doesn’t want that.”
Velocity frowned.
“Might go for all of us at once. It’s got enough fucking tentacles.”
Binyelum raised a finger to their chin.
“Jhansi.”
Wait.
Huh?
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum repeated, “Jhansi.”
Oh shit.
She should reply.
“Huh?”
Sebastian looked at her and made a face.
“Is she gonna throw up?”
Oh fuck off.
Binyelum stared at Jhansi.
“You’re gonna stand guard while the rest of us climb the ladder. If that thing makes any kind of a sudden movement, hit it with your fire extinguisher.”
Jhansi looked down at her weapon, then back at Binyelum.
She shook her head.
“I can’t reach.”
Binyelum’s eyes flashed.
“Aw. You can’t reach?”
Oh fuck.
Binyelum’s mouth lit into a grin.
“That’s okay, tryhardling.”
Oh no.
Binyelum waggled their fingers.
“Spray it.”
Fuck.
Heat filled Jhansi’s face.
Static crackled.
Jhansi squeezed the fire extinguisher.
“Oh.”
She nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum stared at her.
“Are you alright? Do you think you can handle that?”
Jhansi blinked.
“S–”
She stuttered.
“–praying?”
Binyelum laughed.
“No, tryhardling.”
They paused.
“Well, yes, if need be.”
They brought a finger to their chin.
“What I mean is, can you handle standing guard?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Right.
Could Jhansi handle watching a monster continue to devour a teenager?
The dark shape certainly thought so.
That sounded like the absolute last thing she wanted to experience right now.
She swallowed.
The sick feeling hadn’t gone away.
She felt Binyelum watching her.
What would they say if she said no?
What would all the Asterlings say?
Sebastian would feel vindicated.
Velocity might side with him.
Would Binyelum revoke her title?
The static crackled again.
Jhansi shook her head.
“It’s no problem. I can handle it.”
She pushed past everyone else.
Binyelum watched her step to the front.
They waved the others into a different formation as Jhansi started up the stairs.
Jhansi clutched her fire extinguisher reflexively against her chest.
The cold metal shocked her senses.
It felt kind of good.
She tightened her grip.
Jhansi kept her gaze fixed on the Honey Pot and her back against the wall as she ascended.
The open void of the stairwell watched her climb.
The sliver of the moon peeked down at Jhansi for just a moment from an arrowslit.
The spiral nature of the stairs had the fun effect of briefly taking Jhansi further away from the Honey Pot, skewing her perspective.
She came back around and its dimensions swelled beyond her expectations.
Jhansi stood six stairs down from the landing, staring up at a monster that filled her vision.
Well.
Of course it did.
How else could it fit an entire teenaged human being in its mouth?
Fuck.
A tendril unfurled, reaching downward.
Not all the way.
But close enough.
The tendril turned toward Jhansi.
It bent and curled.
As though beckoning her.
Fuck!
Nasty fucking freak.
Jhansi heard Sebastian's voice from behind her.
She jumped a little.
“Hey look, someone in the netherlume shift actually likes Jhansi.”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She heard Velocity slap Sebastian's arm.
Probably whispering some bullshit agreement.
Double ugh.
Jhansi looked back.
Oh shit!
All those fucking cool kids stood watching her.
Jhansi looked forward.
She inhaled.
She had to do this.
She couldn't fucking chicken out in front of them.
Jhansi looked down at her fire extinguisher.
She unhooked the hose from its housing.
A safety pin held the handle locked in place.
Jhansi removed the pin and tossed it into the open void.
She held her weapon ready and stepped forward.
Up one stair.
And again.
All the way up onto the landing.
She held the fire extinguisher forward, hand trembling on the handle, hose pointed up at the Honey Pot.
The lounging tentacle flicked.
Jhansi tensed.
The tentacle curled up.
And away.
Fuck.
Jhansi stepped forward.
Pooh Bear’s sneakers dangled above her.
A wet, sucking sound came from somewhere inside the Honey Pot’s body.
Pooh Bear’s body disappeared deeper inside.
Another stream of blood gushed forth.
Jhansi gasped.
She backed away quickly.
Double fuck.
She turned red, embarrassed and frustrated.
The monster could probably have killed her right there.
It could have grabbed her arm and pulled her off her feet and–
The dark shape seethed.
No.
Nope.
Not something she wanted to think about right now.
Jhansi looked around the landing.
Where should she stand?
Beneath the alterling?
Fucking nightmare.
The red-painted iron railing wrapped around the perimeter of the landing. 
Jhansi positioned her back against the railing, past the ladder and alongside the door onto the thirteenth floor, still close enough to catch the alterling with the fire extinguisher, but out of the way of everyone else.
“Ready.”
She glanced at the line of Asterlings.
Sebastian led the way, with Velocity behind, then Nancy, Binyelum, and Oren last.
Oren last?
Something to do with his gift.
Sebastian looked up at the Honey Pot as he crossed onto the landing.
It shuddered.
Jhansi tensed.
Sebastian backed away.
He looked at the ladder, then at his barbell.
“Fuck.”
He looked around.
The Honey Pot quivered.
Jhansi tensed again.
Sebastian stared at the Honey Pot.
He blinked.
He leaned the barbell against the wall next to the ladder.
“Velocity, hand this up to me.”
Velocity nodded.
Sebastian grabbed the ladder and pulled himself upward.
The Honey Pot barely moved.
Jhansi tensed again.
Just in case.
Velocity stepped forward.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Velocity grabbed Sebastian's barbell and handed it upward.
Sebastian leaned down to grab it.
The Honey Pot chittered.
Oh for fuck’s sake!
Jhansi tensed yet again.
“Knock it off!”
Everyone looked at her.
The Honey Pot dismissively raised and lowered a tendril.
Velocity shook their head.
They climbed the ladder, their bat banging against every other rung.
Nancy stepped up.
She stared at the Honey Pot.
It gurgled, pulling Pooh Bear’s corpse deeper inside itself.
Blood gushed.
The monster had swallowed nearly all of the teenager’s torso. 
It no longer needed to hold Pooh Bear around the waist.
Two more tendrils swung freely.
Jhansi said, “I’m serious!”
The Honey Pot didn’t respond.
Nancy squeezed her ax.
She glared at the Honey Pot, flipped her ax over in her palm, again, and again, then mounted the stairs and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Binyelum stepped up.
They grinned at Jhansi.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Binyelum gave Jhansi two thumbs up.
They mounted the stairs and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Oren stepped up.
He raised both eyebrows at the Honey Pot.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Oren draped his chainlock across his neck and back over his shoulders like an unhooked necklace, mounted the stairs, and climbed.
The Honey Pot remained motionless.
Jhansi blinked.
Her turn had come.
She looked up the ladder.
It seemed unreasonably tall.
Binyelum’s head appeared over the edge.
“Your services are worthy.”
They smiled.
“You may ascend.”
Jhansi looked back at the Honey Pot.
Two barbed tendrils whipped toward her!
Jhansi screamed.
The tendrils backed away.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Jhansi shook her head.
“You fucking brat!”
The Honey Pot jostled.
Moonlight winked off Binyelum’s machete up above.
Huh.
Jhansi blinked.
She stepped toward the ladder.
She stared at the Honey Pot.
She swallowed.
She mounted the ladder and climbed it as quickly as possible, her legs pistoning, her knees banging against a new rung with each thrust, her hand squeezing the textured metal bars hard enough to hurt, the fire extinguisher clattering.
Halfway up, a sensation took hold.
Jhansi saw herself.
An utterly defense creature.
Hanging in midair hundreds of feet above an open pit.
Boxed in with a hungry and lethal predator.
Her body hummed.
Her world narrowed to a pinpoint.
The platform above.
Jhansi blinked.
She panted.
She stood with her hands on her knees.
She looked over at the corner of the room.
The Honey Pot waved at her.
Oh fuck off!
Jhansi stormed after Binyelum.
She stepped out of the short corridor and into the night.
Binyelum grinned at her.
“First live one, huh?”
Jhansi glared.
“It’s fucking terrifying.”
Binyelum giggled.
“Yeah, it really is.”
They looked up.
“It really, really fucking is.”
Jeez.
A lot of respect for a fucking monster.
An alterling.
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
“You were an alterling.”
Binyelum’s eyes lit up.
“What makes you say that?”
Jhansi shrugged.
“It just makes sense?”
Binyelum nodded.
“I’m glad you feel that way.”
They grinned.
Then snorted.
“Duh.”
They playfully slapped her shoulder and stepped back.
“You think I was a fucking endling?”
Sebastian gave Binyelum a look.
Binyelum.
An alterling.
Jhansi pointed back over her shoulder at the corridor to the stairwell.
“Like that one?”
Binyelum barked a laugh.
They shook their head.
They smiled and raised an eyebrow.
“What kind of alterling do you think I was?”
Jhansi blushed.
She made a face.
Why the embarrassment?
Why hadn’t she realized this sooner?
Why hadn’t she wondered about anyone’s past?
Jhansi blinked.
“Holy shit.”
Binyelum raised an eyebrow.
“Too scary to think about?”
Jhansi snorted.
She shook her head.
“No.”
She paused.
“Well yes, but no. Just.”
She gestured.
“You all really were monsters, huh?”
Binyelum gave her a strange look.
“And you weren’t?”
Ugh!
Jhansi made a face.
“Binyelum!”
Binyelum said nothing.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I’ve told you!”
She gestured.
“Like a thousand times.”
Binyelum stared at her for longer than she would have liked.
They shrugged.
“We’ll see.”
They paused.
“Have you been working on that memory?”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“Memory?”
Binyelum made a face.
They spoke slowly.
“Yes, Jhansi. The memory you acquired back at The Rescue.”
They stared.
What?
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh! Right!”
Shit.
“That memory! Of course!”
Jhansi nodded.
She grinned.
Binyelum made a different face.
“Glad you’re up to speed.”
They frowned.
“Now. Do you remember any of it?”
Oh.
Double shit.
Jhansi actually hadn’t worked on that at all.
Her grin weakened.
“Um. Not yet?”
Binyelum’s expression darkened.
“Do what you’re good at–”
They gestured.
“–and try.”
They turned before Jhansi could reply.
Ugh.
Whatever.
Binyelum crossed the roof toward the ledge where the Asterlings had gathered, on the west side of the building.
Jhansi hurried to catch up.
Velocity gestured outward.
“Behold.”
Jhansi still couldn’t see shit.
Well.
No.
As she stared, her eyes began to pick up the distant glow of nebulites. Tiny pinpricks of color gleamed through the cloak. The longer Jhansi looked, the more she found herself able to guess at the locations of the nebulites.
A heavy emerald glow emanated from where Jhansi guessed they would find Bridgemall.
Flickers of gold danced here and there.
Headlights.
Sebastian said, “This sucks.”
Binyelum said, “First special one I ever ate–”
Wait what?
“–was a cups, whose gift allowed the receiver to see through the cloak, through the eyes of the giver.”
Sebastian frowned.
“A cups? Sounds like a pentacles thing to me.”
Velocity said, “I was thinking a swords.”
Binyelum shrugged.
“You would think so.”
What the hell did all this mean?
Jhansi gave Binyelum a look.
“Cups? Pentacles? Swords?”
Binyelum smiled.
Oren said, “Three of the four suits.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Suits?”
Oren nodded.
He held up four fingers, then pulled each of them down.
“Cups. Wands. Swords. Pentacles.”
He gestured.
“Our gifts fall under one of the four suits.”
Fascinating.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“What do the classifications mean?”
Oren smiled.
“Pentacles restore the body, or provide a boon. Swords alter the body in some way that doesn’t restore it. Wands move the body, or cause the body to move other objects. Cups affect things like thought, feeling, and memory.”
Holy shit.
Jhansi’s smile broadened.
She looked around at the Asterlings.
“What are your classifications?”
Velocity smirked.
“Princess wants to get to know us.”
What?
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“I’m just curious.”
Velocity’s smirk grew into a leer.
“About what?”
Oh.
Jhansi blinked.
She blushed.
Oren said, “I’m a three of wands.”
Huh.
Jhansi looked at him.
Such a small number.
Velocity luxuriated.
“I’m a ten of pentacles.”
Huh.
Jhansi looked at them.
Big difference.
Sebastian said, “Five of pentacles.”
Huh.
It made sense according to the rules.
But.
Where did Sebastian and Velocity’s personalities overlap?
Bineylum said, “I’m a knight of swords.”
Oh for fuck’s sake.
Of fucking course.
Jhansi couldn’t stop herself from making a face.
Binyelum beamed at her.
Fuck.
More teasing.
But no.
Binyelum pointed their thumb at Nancy.
They leaned forward just a little.
“Nancy’s an ace.”
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
Nancy.
An ace?
Jhansi said, “Of swords?”
The corners of Nancy’s mouth quirked slightly upward.
She stared at Jhansi.
Oh.
Fuck.
Wild.
And she didn’t wear her mask?
An ace who refused to use their gift?
Jhansi said, “Is ace highest or lowest?”
Binyelum and Nancy looked at each other.
They both shrugged at the same time.
Of course.
Always the fucking esoterica.
Velocity and Sebastian had even expressed confusion over the suit of Bineylum’s first–
Waitaminute.
Jhansi said, “Hang on.”
She looked at Binyelum.
“You really killed a special one?”
Everyone looked at her.
Binyelum made a face.
“Yes?”
Oren said, “We all have.”
Jhansi blinked.
“But I thought that was like, one of the bad things.”
Binyelum pursed their lips.
“If you're a special one, yeah.”
They furrowed their brows.
“Why is this surprising?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“I don't know. Just …”
She pictured Binyelum as a gruesome shape hunched over a body, pulling it apart, devouring limbs, a thousand mouths and eyes swirling in a corporeal shadow.
All the eyes looked toward Jhansi.
What?
The dark shape roiled.
She felt hot.
What the fuck?
Jhansi looked away.
“I don't know.”
Oren put a hand on Jhansi's shoulder.
Jhansi started.
Binyelum returned their attention to the occluded sprawl of the city.
They stared.
Jhansi watched the distant nebulites flicker.
Binyelum crossed their arms.
“Quiet night.”
A massive pillar of white light erupted to the north, deep into the suburbs, miles away but still clearly visible through the cloak.
Everyone turned toward it.
The pillar of light kept stretching higher into the sky.
Particles drifted away from it at the edges.
A rushing sound, moaning white noise, surged through the city.
Oh fuck.
Jhansi’s stomach dropped.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum grinned.
“That’s more like it.”
Velocity took a step back.
“Holy shit.”
Binyelum gave Velocity a look.
“You know what that is?”
Velocity made a strange face.
“Maybe.”
The light wavered like a flame.
It broke away from the ground.
It dissipated in pieces.
Fragments drifted upward, diminishing slowly before winking out.
Oh double fuck.
Oren’s hand landed on Jhansi’s shoulder.
Binyelum exhaled.
“Well, hopefully we’ll never find out what that means.”
They nodded.
The other Asterlings looked amongst each other.
Binyelum gestured out at the city.
“Aside from that dead angel or whatever, this is nothing. It’s early, but it’s not that early. We're two hours in and nobody’s acting out?”
They shook their head.
“Weird.”
They looked south, away from the river.
They turned and looked east, back across the rooftop toward the ocean.
They looked up at the moon.
“Weird.”
Maybe it had something to do with Jhansi’s presence?
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Nope, probably shouldn’t share that thought.
Jhansi blatted.
She started over.
“I guess we can take the highway to Bridgemall after all?”
Binyelum looked at her.
“What was that?”
Oh fuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
“What was what?”
She blew a raspberry.
“Nothing.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Nothing.”
They paused, then looked back at the city.
“No highways. This–”
They gestured outward.
“–means everyone's still probably lying in wait.”
They nodded.
“We’ll drive through the neighborhoods.”
Jhansi looked northwest.
A grouping of red nebulites twinkled in the distance.
“Won’t everyone be getting restless? What if they start moving into the neighborhoods?”
Binyelum gave her an appraising look.
“Huh.”
They smiled.
“Look at you.”
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum continued.
“Good observation. That's probably what comes next. Let's get back to Mambele and head to Bridgemall before we get caught up in it.”
Oh.
Shit.
Had they just given her a compliment?
Bineylum gave the city a final look, then turned back toward the stairwell.
Back toward the Honey Pot.
Ugh.
Jhansi said, “Am I supposed to go first?”
Binyelum paused and cupped their chin.
“Yeah.”
They nodded.
“Same order we came out. Oren, you pass Sebastian’s barbell down to him.”
Oren nodded.
Sebastian said, “Eager to get your hands back on my rod?”
Velocity barked.
Oren smirked.
He shrugged.
“Found it pretty light, pretty easy to handle.”
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity tutted.
“Oren’s point.”
Sebastian cursed.
“Pej!”
Binyelum smiled at them.
“We’re keeping score?”
Sebastian pressed his lips into a tight, awkward smile and gave an ironic thumbs up.
“Quantifiable proof of my superiority and value! Something my mom can be proud of!”
Velocity blinked.
“Wow.”
Oren said, “Your mom’s proud of your lightweight rod?”
Sebastian burst into laughter.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Sebastian spat, “Pejudo!”
Jhansi said, “Okay, what the fuck does that mean?”
Binyelum loomed.
“It means we have to get going. C’mon.”
They waved Jhansi along.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She didn’t protest.
Sebastian handed his barbell to Oren, waggled his eyebrows, and fell in behind Jhansi. 
Jhansi stepped up to the doorway of the short corridor.
Fuck.
Okay.
More monster mastication.
Jhansi swallowed.
She paused.
Something about the space inside looked strange.
She dropped to her knees and peered in further.
“Oh shit.”
Sebastian stepped forward alongside Jhansi.
“Oh shit.”
Binyelum said, “What?”
Jhansi said, “It's gone.”
The empty stairwell stared back at her.
Jhansi stood.
Moonlight arced across the cooled pool of blood.
Jhansi turned around.
Binyelum stood there, smirking.
Of course.
Binyelum said, “Of course.”
Jhansi looked back at the stairwell.
“What if it’s waiting behind the door for me?”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They grinned.
“What happens when the monster captures the princess?”
Fuck!
What?
Jhansi blushed.
She shook her head.
“What?”
She shook her head harder.
“Since when am I the princess?”
She shook her head even harder.
“I thought I was just a tryhardling.”
Binyelum’s grin flashed.
“New rank.”
They nodded.
“Princess tryhardling.”
What?!
Jhansi blinked.
“What?!”
Sebastian said, “We can marry her off to a rival kingdom.”
Double what?!
Jhansi glared.
Binyelum shook their head.
“Let's hope we don't have to.”
They sighed theatrically.
“That’ll probably be when she awakens her hidden gift!”
They swept a hand across their throat.
“And then she’ll come back for revenge.”
Wait.
What?
Hidden gift?
Jhansi said, “You think I have a hidden gift?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“We’ll see.”
They pushed Jhansi back down the corridor.
Hey!
Binyelum peered into the stairwell.
“No trail.”
They cupped their chin.
Well what the fuck?
Jhansi said, “How did it move?”
Binyelum looked at her.
“Probably like a clam or–”
They gestured.
“–something.”
Oh shit.
Jhansi blinked.
“Clams can move?”
Binyelum snorted.
“Oh my God, Jhansi.”
Jhansi made a face.
“What?!”
She threw up her hands.
“I don't know!”
Binyelum snickered.
“This is why you’re a princess.”
What?!
Jhansi made a face and crossed her arms.
Binyelum looked back toward the stairwell.
“Okay. I'm gonna go first. Nancy, watch my back. If it doesn't go for the jump scare, Velocity, you come down next. Then Sebastian, Oren, Jhansi, and Nancy.”
Everyone nodded.
Binyelum mounted the stairs.
They clambered partway down the ladder, winked at everyone, and lowered themselves further.
Sebastian deadpanned, “And they were never heard from again.”
Nothing moved in the darkness.
Binyelum reached the landing.
They looked around, shrugged, and waved down Velocity.
Velocity descended the ladder.
They bumped fists.
Binyelum pointed at the door.
Velocity gripped their bat.
They stepped forward.
They raised their bat with their right arm.
Binyelum tensed, holding their machete ready with their left hand and holding their right out to grab Velocity’s wrist.
Velocity turned the door handle and pushed.
It didn't budge.
Velocity paused.
They tried again, pulling.
The door still didn’t budge.
Locked.
Velocity shrugged to themselves.
They turned to Binyelum.
They gave a thumbs up.
The door exploded outward, knocking Binyelum and Velocity over the railing and into the open pit of the stairwell.
Wait.
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity stared up at her.
What the hell had just happened?
A hallucination?
Sebastian handed their barbell to Oren, then climbed down.
Oren mimed throwing Sebastian’s barbell over the edge into the void.
Jhansi giggled.
Sebastian glared.
Oren passed down the barbell.
Sebastian grabbed it with both hands.
“Such a delicate touch, just the way I like it.”
Oren nodded.
Oren replied, “Didn't think you could handle any more than that.”
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Oren said, “That’s three.”
Binyelum smiled.
“That means you’ve earned a new title.”
Wait.
What?
Don’t give anyone else a special title!
Oren gave Binyelum a weird smile.
“Oh boy.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Derp Herp Himbo.”
Oren burst into laughter.
Velocity made a face.
Sebastian made a face.
Nancy made an extreme face.
Jhansi blinked.
Velocity said, “What the fuck was that?”
Sebastian shook his head.
“It doesn’t matter. There can be no justification.”
Nancy shook her head.
Oren’s laughter subsided.
He ran a hand through his hair.
“It’s …”
He gestured.
“Something from the past.”
Sebastian shook his head again.
“It doesn’t matter.”
He shook his head harder.
“No justification.”
Binyelum said, “Title disputes can only be settled via formal blood sports.”
Oren mimed cracking his knuckles.
Sebastian made a face.
“Such a brute.”
Oren frowned.
“Weren’t you just praising my delicate touch?”
Sebastian made a different face.
Velocity said, “Another point for Oren.”
Oren shrugged.
“Already out of my Herp Derp phase.”
He descended the ladder.
Binyelum said, “But not your Himbo phase?”
Oren reached the landing.
He grinned at Binyelum.
“Why would I ever want to quit that?”
Then the conversation ended.
Nobody moved.
Nobody spoke.
What?
Weird.
Oh!
Right.
Jhansi’s turn.
Jhansi climbed down the ladder, the fire extinguisher smacking her on the head only once.
Perfect.
Nancy followed, gracefully sliding down the ladder.
She flourished her ax with a smile.
Binyelum gestured.
The Asterlings took the stairs at a measured pace.
Binyelum looked relaxed, but they clenched their machete tight.
They reached the next landing.
The door creaked inward.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Dark tendrils whipped over the threshold, roughly grabbing Binyelum before anyone could react, lifting them into the air and spreading their limbs. Hungry barbs split their flesh, pumping poison into their exposed muscles. Their body began to seize. A coiled tendril tightened around their neck, holding them firmly in place. Their eyes bulged. Foam bubbled from their open wounds and spewed from their mouth. The tendril around their neck squeezed. It twisted. It pulled. It separated Binyelum’s head from their shoulders in a bursting shower of blood, the gleaming white of their broken spine reflected in their empty eyes.
The dark shape shuddered.
Nancy patted Jhansi’s head.
What?
Fuck.
Fuck!
Jhansi turned.
Her face felt so hot.
Her chest heaved.
Nancy raised both eyebrows.
Jhansi shook her head.
“It’s not–”
Nancy smirked.
She shook her head, then nodded Jhansi onward.
Jhansi smiled weakly and hurried down the stairs.
Fuck.
The hallucinations.
They wouldn’t stop.
Would they keep getting worse?
For the entire rest of the night?
Fuck.
Should she ask someone about it?
Absolutely fucking not.
Admitting that she had compulsive visions of the Asterlings’ violent deaths really would get her left on the side of the fucking road.
Jhansi banged her other elbow on something.
Fuck!
The same damn metal thing as earlier!
This time she could see it.
The case for a fire extinguisher, mounted on the wall.
Of course.
Binyelum moved into the lobby.
The Asterlings followed.
Mambele's headlights beamed in through the entryway.
Relief washed over Jhansi.
Binyelum gestured the Asterlings outside, themselves keeping watch on the lobby, staring down the hall of elevators as everyone took a turn crossing over the broken door.
Jhansi stepped light and quick, keeping her eyes focused on Mambele, plunging into the cool night air.
Jhansi turned as Binyelum emerged from the building.
She looked up toward the top of the tower, some two-hundred feet overhead.
From down here, Jhansi couldn't see shit.
But.
Somewhere in there lurked the Honey Pot.
Jhansi said, “Should we leave a warning or something?”
Binyelum looked at her with an indecipherable expression.
Sebastian frowned.
“Like what? Cut off their limbs?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“No?”
She shrugged.
“Yes?”
She gestured.
“Maybe?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That's not how this works, tryhardling.”
Oh come on.
Jhansi made a face.
“What? What do you mean? You’re just going to let some other kids get fucking eaten?”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Maybe.”
They shrugged again.
“Maybe the alterling will starve and die if we interfere.”
What?
Jhansi scowled.
“What?”
She furrowed her brows.
“Starve?”
Binyelum nodded.
“And not just from lack of attention.”
Ugh.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I thought you said alterlings eat memory cards to change their bodies.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s part of it, yes.”
They gestured.
“Some shapes require upkeep.”
Fair.
But.
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“Okay but why do you care?”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“Because it’s more fun.”
What the fuck?
More fun?
To watch kids die?
Obviously not.
So what?
Had they meant this as some kind of test?
Trick the interloper into admitting their devious plans?
Static blinked to life around the perimeter of Jhansi's interior space.
She scowled.
“Please, Binyelum, tell me how it’s fun to watch kids get eaten.”
Binyelum’s mouth tightened.
They exhaled through their nose.
“That’s not what’s fun, Jhansi.”
Ugh.
The static chimed.
Jhansi deepened her scowl.
“Then why aren’t you trying to stop it?”
She waved her arms around.
“I thought that was the whole point. To save the kids.”
Binyelum pinched the bridge of their nose.
“How many times do I have to tell you, Jhansi?”
They shook their head.
“That’s not how this works.”
The static chimed again, louder, crackling as it pulled away from the walls of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi stamped her foot.
“Then how does it work, Binyelum?”
Binyelum threw up their hands.
“It works however you want it to work.”
Wait.
Not an indictment?
The static fizzled.
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum sighed.
They gestured around.
“It’s just a world–”
They gestured again.
“–with rules.”
They shrugged.
“You can play however the fuck you want.”
What?
A game has rules.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Really?”
She crossed her arms.
“And how exactly do you want to play?”
Binyelum looked directly into Jhansi’s eyes.
“I want to have fun.”
The static hummed.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“How is it fun watching kids die?”
Binyelum stared.
Their nostrils flared.
They sighed.
“It’s fun playing a hard game.”
They gestured.
“It’s fun to watch people make choices.”
They gestured again.
“It’s fun to see the shape of the consequences.”
They lazily threw their arms wide.
“It’s fun to just let it happen, organically.”
They pointed at Jhansi.
“I want to participate, to hurt and be hurt. I don’t want to control the game or shape the outcome. I just want to play.”
Well, fine.
Jhansi shrugged.
“That’s cool. You do you.”
She gestured.
“I want to play the game in a way where I save people.”
Bineylum gave her a look.
They sighed.
“Whatever.”
They shrugged.
“Fine. Have it your way.”
Oh.
Wow.
The static dissipated.
Binyelum gestured.
“See how that works out for you.”
Nice.
An easy victory.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“We will.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They gave Jhansi a wan smirk.
“We sure will, tryhardling.”
A metallic bang cut through the parking lot.
Jhansi turned.
Nancy and Velocity stood on opposite sides of Mambele’s trunk
Velocity bent double and groaned.
Nancy slowly crossed her arms, her mouth creasing with the faintest lines of self-satisfaction.
Velocity shook out their left hand.
“Fuck!”
Nancy rolled her shoulders.
Oren patted Velocity on the back.
Binyelum said, “You thought it would end different this time?”
Velocity shouted, “Ugh!”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Did you at least try a different approach?”
Velocity repeated, louder, “Ugh.”
Jhansi blinked.
“What?”
Binyelum flexed their biceps.
“Displays of physical superiority.”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked away.
Well.
This explained how Velocity had ended up in the back seat instead of riding shotgun.
How the fuck did Velocity think they could beat Nancy?
Velocity stood upright.
They cracked their knuckles.
“Well, whatever.”
They shrugged.
“I still want to reroll for the back seat.”
Binyelum smirked.
“No longer interested in being our princess’s throne?”
Binyelum glanced at Jhansi.
“Some people would consider that an honor.”
What?!
Jhansi’s face burned.
“What?!”
Sebastian raised both hands.
“Don’t include me. I’m not trying to disrupt the hierarchy.”
Binyelum gave him a look, then turned to Oren.
“How about it? Wanna step into the arena?”
Oren shrugged.
“Might as well.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Not the shining paragon of competitive spirit, but good enough.”
Oren gave them a sour look.
Binyelum cupped their chin.
“Let’s see.”
Their voice trailed off.
They looked around the parking lot.
Their gaze landed on Jhansi.
“Jhansi!”
Now what?
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“Yes?”
Binyelum pointed at her.
“Think of a color.”
They nodded.
“Whoever guesses closest will be your new throne.”
Jhansi’s face continued to burn.
Velocity said, “Ah, so the aim is to lose.”
Ugh.
Jhansi stuck out her tongue.
She shook her head.
“What about me? I want to play for my own seat. Make Velocity sit in Oren’s lap or something!”
Velocity waggled their eyebrows at Oren.
Oren winked in response.
Binyelum laughed.
“You’re renouncing your throne, princess? Your title goes with it, you know.”
Good.
Jhansi nodded emphatically.
“Yes.”
She nodded even harder.
“Obviously.”
Binyelum smiled.
“Obviously.”
They paused.
“Unfortunately, that won’t work. Abdication is forbidden. If you want a different title, you have to earn it.”
Jhansi clenched her fists.
“Fuck!”
Binyelum laughed.
“Pick a fucking color, nerd.”
Bastard.
Jhansi glared.
She crossed her arms and huffed.
She looked around the parking lot.
Well, what?
Black.
The overwhelming experience of the netherlume shift.
Except.
It didn’t fit the game very well.
With all other colors equidistant.
So, what?
Hm.
Jhansi nodded.
“I’m ready.”
Sebastian said, “How will you know she’s not cheating?”
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“How would I cheat?”
Binyelum laughed.
“You really think our princess is a cheater.”
Sebastian shrugged.
“I’m just saying–”
He gestured at Jhansi.
“–she’s hard to trust.”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
Binyelum smiled, showing teeth.
“She is.”
What?!
Jhansi gave them a look.
“Hey!”
Bineylum turned to Oren with a sweeping gesture.
“The game begins!”
Oren blinked.
“What? Me?”
Binyelum repeated their gesture.
“Yes!”
Oren made a face.
He lept backward into a pose. He waved both hands in midair, as though pulling energy from somewhere. He paused, inhaled, and thrust both hands forward, palms open wide, as though blasting Jhansi with the energy he had summoned.
“A buttery sunset yellow!”
Oh come on.
Jhansi blinked.
She looked at Binyelum.
“More of this?”
Binyelum ignored her and applauded Oren.
“The paragon of the competitive spirit!”
Oren bowed.
Binyelum pulled both arms behind their back and leaned toward Velocity.
“And what say you, charismatic challenger?”
Velocity snorted.
“Charismatic?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“C’mon, we’re pressed for time.”
Velocity laughed.
They threw their arm out straight, pointing their bat directly at Jhansi’s face. The rush of air sent Jhansi’s hair fluttering. She stared cross-eyed at the barrel of the makeshift weapon.
“Dark blue!”
Damn.
Jhansi made a face.
“Wow.”
She looked at Binyelum.
“Velocity wins.”
Velocity clenched their fists.
“Shit!”
Jhansi shook her head.
“No, I mean.”
She waved her hands.
“Wait.”
She bowed onto one knee, pushing her other leg behind her, sweeping her arm wide in an elaborate, flapping gesture.
She pulled her face into as austere an expression as she could manage.
She pointed directly at Velocity from her outstretched hand.
“You–”
She raised both hands and looked skyward.
“–were perfectly wrong!”
She contorted her face into a mask of fury, brought her arms back down by her sides, and glared at Velocity.
She almost toppled over, but caught herself.
She pushed on.
“The duty of administering judgment during the Sacred Rite of Chromatic Divination has been the birthright of my clan for centuries, and not once in the recorded history of my people have we encountered an answer as wrong as yours!”
She looked back at Binyelum.
“Velocity is, unequivocally, the loser.”
Binyelum clapped.
“Marvelous!”
Velocity made a face.
“Look ma, recognition!”
Oren chuckled.
Binyelum nodded.
“Oren–”
They waved both hands.
“–would you kindly gain access to the transportation vessel and assume your rightful place as our princess’s throne.”
Wow.
Oren nodded.
He turned to Jhansi.
“What was the color?”
Jhansi grinned.
“Bright orange.”
Velocity snorted.
Oren grinned.
Binyelum grinned too.
Oren popped the trunk, but Binyelum shook their head.
“We’re gonna keep our stuff ready going forward.”
Sebastian raised an eyebrow.
“You want my rod flailing around in the back seat?”
Binyelum laughed.
“Good point.”
They shook their head.
“Nobody wants that.”
They gestured.
“Pack that shit away.”
Sebastian stuck out his tongue.
“Pack it into your mom.”
Binyelum waggled a finger.
“AI–”
Sebastian interrupted.
“Yeah right.”
He shut his barbell in the trunk, then filed into the backseat with Oren and Velocity.
Nancy rode shotgun.
Jhansi ducked partway into the vehicle, then turned, taking one last look at the Washington Center Tower.
The Honey Pot flashed before her eyes.
Fuck.
She stepped back onto the asphalt and sprinted around to the passenger’s side door.
Binyelum groaned.
“What now?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“Hang on!”
She turned to Nancy.
“Hey, um, sorry. Can you, er, scootch your knees?”
Nancy blinked at Jhansi, then slowly pulled her knees up to her chest with unwavering grace.
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
“Thanks.”
She popped open the glove compartment.
Binyelum laughed.
“Hey!”
They ducked into Mambele and reached toward Jhansi.
“My privacy!”
Jhansi looked at them.
“A princess has a right to her subjects’ privacy!”
Binyelum paused.
They shook their head.
“I had no idea I’d be crowning such a tyrant.”
Jhansi grinned.
She searched the glove compartment.
She found a pile of envelopes, which she supposed would suffice, but she’d hoped to find something more aesthetic.
She looked at Binyelum.
“Yeah? Have I earned a new title? Tyrant tryhardling?”
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
“What are you looking for?”
Jhansi grinned.
She searched deeper into the glove compartment.
She found an automotive manual beneath the envelopes, which suited her better, but Binyelum might get upset if she started ripping out pages.
She looked at Binyelum.
“My own book of rules.”
Binyelum sighed.
“Jhansi–”
Jhansi made a face.
She searched deeper into the glove compartment.
The corner of a pack of playing cards peeked up at her from the very bottom of the receptacle.
Perfect.
She snatched it up smiled at Binyelum.
“Do you have a pen?”
Binyelum gave her a look.
“Jhansi–”
Jhansi interrupted.
“I’m not leaving a warning, okay?”
She gestured.
“I'm just doing my own thing.”
She paused.
“I'm playing the way I want.”
Binyelum searched her face.
“Passenger’s side door pocket.”
Jhansi looked down.
Folded stacks of maintenance receipts overflowed from the small crevasse.
She plunged her hand into the mess and pulled out a red Sharpie.
“Red.”
It would do.
She opened the pack of cards, squeezed the cardboard, and grabbed the worn, softened corner of a card at random.
The two of hearts.
She set it on Mambele's hood and scrawled a message across its face.
I BELIEVE IN YOU
She added little stars here and there.
For kicks.
Jhansi placed the pack of cards and the Sharpie in her canvas bag.
Binyelum blinked at her over Mambele's hood.
Jhansi hurried back to the shattered door. Staccato footsteps followed her across the parking lot. The collective gazes of the Asterlings followed her like a spotlight.
She examined the shape of the spray of glass, knelt near the center, and delicately lifted a larger piece. A bright moment of pain lit up her middle finger. A thin line of red appeared.
Fucking great.
Jhansi placed the playing card face up on the ground and weighed it down with the piece of glass.
The glass distorted her message, stretching the letters and symbols beyond their original dimensions.
It would make a difference.
Right?
Jhansi whispered, “I hope this helps.”
Binyelum called, “C’mon!”
Jhansi stood and hurried back to Mambele.
Goosebumps prickled her arms as she ducked inside, welcomed without question into an embrace of sound and color.
Oren had said something about Mambele's capacity to alleviate the mental strain of the netherlume shift, right?
It began to make sense.
Jhansi sat in Oren’s lap.
It felt warmer than Velocity's.
Heat rose in her cheeks.
What a weird fucking thought.
Oren smiled.
“Welcome aboard.”
Jhansi’s blush deepened.
Binyelum lowered themselves into Mambele.
They looked straight at Jhansi.
Jhansi’s blush deepened even further.
Fuck.
No.
She pushed through.
She raised her nose and sniffed.
“A suitable palanquin.”
Oren smiled wider.
“If I was your palanquin, wouldn't somebody have to carry me?”
Jhansi shook her head.
“You can crab walk.”
Oren burst into laughter.
Binyelum snorted.
Nancy blinked slowly.
Sebastian recoiled.
“Wow.”
Velocity shook their head.
“Everything becomes a crab eventually.”
Huh.
An unexpected comment from Velocity.
Binyelum looked at Oren.
“Shoulda picked a better color.”
Oren shrugged.
“No problem. I was the divisional crab walking champion two years in a row.”
Sebastian gave Oren a look.
“That–”
He paused.
“–sounds like noneling behavior.”
Oren gave Sebastian a face that turned Jhansi's stomach.
Wow.
Okay.
What the hell did that mean?
She looked around.
“Noneling?”
She didn't get a response.
A shadow flickered across Binyelum’s face.
Everyone else’s expression settled into something uncomfortable.
Fascinating.
What else had made the Asterlings react like this?
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“Is that like the Mezzoforte or whatever?”
Still no reply.
Nancy gave her a weird look.
Pitying?
Sebastian made a harsher face.
“The what?”
Binyelum chuckled darkly.
“No.”
They paused.
“A noneling is nothing like the Mesonoxian.”
They paused again.
They brought a finger to their chin.
“Well. Actually.”
They shrugged.
“Maybe.”
Sebastian raised his eyebrows.
“Maybe?”
Binyelum gave him a look.
“Do you know where the Mesonoxian came from?”
Sebastian closed his mouth.
Binyelum continued.
“Plus, they’re not completely dissimilar.”
Velocity frowned.
“Not dissimilar?”
Okay.
Jhansi couldn’t follow along any further.
“Excuse me.”
She gestured.
“What the fuck is a noneling?”
Everyone blinked at her.
Binyelum opened their mouth, but Oren spoke first.
“On very rare occasions–”
Binyelum gave him a look, but he continued.
“–if a special one survives until the end of the netherlume shift, Egaeus’s gift won’t kill them.”
What the fuck?!
Jhansi opened her mouth, but Oren continued.
“It’ll turn them into a noneling.”
What the entire fuck?!
Special ones didn’t have to die?!
Jhansi glared.
“You told me–”
Oren blinked at her with wide, reproachful eyes.
Oh.
Huh.
Jhansi blinked back at him.
Oren said, “A noneling is pretty much dead.”
He paused.
“It’s a shambling abomination.”
Wow.
What a word.
Jhansi blinked again.
“Oh.”
She paused.
“So like a zombie?”
Oren laughed darkly.
“Sure.”
He paused.
“If we ever see one, just fucking run.”
Run?
Jhansi blinked yet again.
“Run?”
Oren shook his head.
“They can’t die.”
He paused again.
“And personally, I’d rather get caught by the Mesonoxian.”
Double wow.
Jhansi frowned.
“If I see one? How would I know?”
Oren nodded.
“You’ll know.”
Huh.
Well.
Triple wow.
Jhansi turned to Binyelum.
“And the Mesonoxian is the only other thing that survives the light of the full moon.”
Binyelum pointed a finger gun at her and pulled the trigger.
“Bingo.”
Fascinating.
Sebastian said, “Are we done?”
Velocity slapped his arm.
“You’re the one who brought it up!”
Sebastian made a face.
“Yeah but I didn’t actually want to talk about it.”
Binyelum clapped.
“Enough!”
Nancy raised an eyebrow.
Sebastian made a face.
Velocity said, “Wow.”
Oren shrugged.
Binyelum nodded.
“The open road calls.”
Jhansi snorted.
Binyelum pulled the driver’s side door closed.
The hood light switched off. The overhead stars lit up. The shifter glowed. It had changed again, into a trapezoidal plane reclined against the dashboard, the face of it marked by dozens of square silicone buttons. A CRT screen filled the top space of the plane, a green light blinking in its center. Binyelum squeezed the clutch trigger on the steering wheel and pressed several of the shifter buttons in a quick sequence. The green light jumped downward on the display. A purple targeting reticle, rendered as a square with two cross lines, closed in on the green light. Binyelum turned the wheel as Mambele reversed.
The green light pulled to the side, and the targeting reticle followed.
Binyelum squeezed the clutch and pressed a different, shorter sequence of buttons.
The green light jumped up toward the top of the display, and the targeting reticle followed.
Mambele pulled out of the parking lot.
The Washington Center receded into the cloak.
Sebastian said something, but Jhansi didn't pay attention.
Relief peaked inside her.
Only for a moment.
A massive wave of exhaustion followed, crashing through her interior space.
What the fuck had just happened?
That hadn’t felt anything like The Rescue.
Jhansi pictured the battered orifice of the Washington Center Tower.
She traced her way back through that ominous lobby, up those hypnotic stairs, straight into the dangling limbs swaying beneath the Honey Pot. The monster’s disgusting mouth pressed hard against her body, smearing her with mucous to ease her passage down its throat. Ropey tendrils squeezed her tight. Barbs dug into her flesh and pumped her full of–
No.
Wait.
That hadn’t happened.
What the fuck?
Why wouldn’t her mind stop doing this?
Jhansi looked around at the other teenagers.
Velocity said, “–sucked her fuckin’ dick!”
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum said, “For fun or for profit?”
Jhansi blinked again.
Sebastian said something too, but she didn’t pay attention.
What the fuck?
Everyone seemed so normal.
Well.
Of course they did.
Not their first rodeo.
Everyone else had seen this …
How many times?
Hundreds?
The alterling and the dead body hadn’t phased them at all.
Jhansi blinked yet again.
She realized she sat staring at Oren.
A cottage-style home illuminated by a buttery yellow exterior nebulite rushed past behind him.	
Oren smiled, the soft curves of his face pillowing upward.
“Hey.”
He paused.
“How are you doing?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked.
“Uh.”
She blinked again.
She looked around.
Nancy sat leaning back in her seat, hands behind her head, eyes closed.
Sebastian leaned past Jhansi, grinning at something he had just said.
Velocity hunched up over the back of Binyelum’s seat and added their input.
Binyelum laughed, one hand on the steering wheel, the other over their mouth.
Well.
It couldn’t get more private than that.
Jhansi shrugged at Oren.
“I’m fine.”
Oren’s mouth flattened.
“Don’t bullshit me. That was a lot. How are you feeling?”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
She searched her interior.
White noise tension.
The same as always.
Jhansi shrugged.
“I don’t know.”
Oren sighed.
“What do you know?”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
“Hey!”
Oren raised both eyebrows.
“Am I wrong?”
 Jhansi sneered.
“Maybe.”
Oren nodded.
He paused.
He looked out the rear window.
“That was pretty fucked up.”
Jhansi followed his gaze.
“The Tower?”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
Jhansi nodded too.
“Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.”
She again looked around at everyone, then back out the rear window.
“Everyone seems fine though.”
Oren looked at her.
“Do they?”
Jhansi made a face.
“Well yeah.”
She gestured around, as though that offered enough explanation.
Oren ran a hand through his hair.
He reached into the pocket of his varsity jacket and pulled out a pack of gum.
He meticulously selected one stick from the collective, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth.
Light slid across the aluminum wrapping.
Oren wadded the wrapping, pushed it into the package, and returned the package to his pocket.
He looked at Jhansi.
“What makes you think any of us are fine?”
What?
Jhansi frowned.
“I dunno.”
She gestured.
“Nobody’s freaking out?”
She gestured again.
“You guys are used to this?”
She gestured yet again.
“You’re just all so fucking cool?”
Oren stared at her.
Oh.
Shit.
Wait.
Jhansi shook her head.
“I–”
Oren laughed.
He nodded slowly.
“You would.”
He nodded again.
“You would think that.”
Well what the hell did that mean?
Jhansi waved her hands.
“What the hell?”
Oren shook his head.
“Yeah, Jhansi. I get it.”
He looked away from her, out the window.
“I don’t want to die either.”
What?
Well, duh.
Jhansi blinked.
“Well duh.”
Oren looked at her with a very strange expression.
“Duh?”
Jhansi made a face.
“Well nobody wants to die.”
Oren stared at her.
The moment lengthened.
Wait.
What?
Jhansi blinked.
She opened her mouth.
Oren said, “You were pretty adamant about not wanting to die earlier.”
He paused.
“And apparently you don’t even know how bad it is.”
Wait.
What?
The fuck?
What the entire fuck?
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Oren leaned past her to join the other conversation.
“Like my uncle always said, that’s just another chuckle in the funk box!”
What the fuck?
Everyone else erupted with laughter.
Seriously.
What the fuck?
What had Oren meant?
Fucking ugh.
Jhansi groaned.
She looked out the driver’s side window.
Mambele rushed around a roundabout illuminated by blue nebulites.
Two blue endlings wearing black uniforms hunched on all fours near the center of the island.
They tore into the meat of a body with their massive teeth.
Orange blood coated the scene.
Jhansi jostled as Mambele went around the curve.
Well fuck.
White noise caught Jhansi’s attention.
She looked around.
Binyelum had turned on the radio.
They spun the dial.
A familiar voice bleated for just a moment.
The Bright Veins.
The white noise returned.
The warm velvet of an unfamiliar feminine voice filled the cabin. 
Goosebumps rose on Jhansi’s skin.
“–fell off the leaderboard last night.”
Jhansi blinked.
The texture of the voice thrummed in her ears.
Binyelum took their hand off the dial.
Velocity said, “Aww, we missed it.”
They smacked the back of Binyelum’s seat.
“Who died?”
The voice continued.
“Next up, hard traffic.”
A brief jingle played, a lonely trumpet melody that thickened and burst into shimmering flickers.
“Uncensored, bedlights, I’m not sure how I feel about these open roads. A night this quiet, that’s gotta be a fairy tale.”
The voice paused.
“But I know I’m not dreaming.”
The voice paused again.
“I do have a couple updates for you.
“First. A riddle. What follows you forever, even in death? I’m not talking about the disapproval of your parents. I’m talking about your silhouette. Soundwaves south of town say there’s a brand new gang forming ranks, Silhouette Entropy. Some kind of mercenary outfit. Spec the situation. I imagine they’re looking for hands, if it suits you.”
Binyelum blinked.
“Well that’s something.”
The voice continued.
“Next. Any of you bedlights spec a big bright light north of town? You’re right to feel some commotion sickness. No confirmation on who did what, but I’m catching rumors of a renegade colorless.”
The voice paused.
“Spec your friends, spec your backs.”
Velocity blanched.
“Oh.”
They blinked.
“Fuck.”
Binyelum looked at them in the rearview mirror.
The voice continued.
“Next up, detours.”
A variation on the jingle played.
“Daytime downtown road construction means fat pain in the ass for all my little bedlights. Spec your step near the high rise apartments north of the river. Fourth, Eighth, and Twelfth are torn up between Chancellor and Faraday.
“While you’re at it, spec your way near the river. We’ve got a statistically impossible daytime interference event–Ironsight Crossing Bridge is up. That’s right. No clue how that happened, but my, what a blessing. Don’t let your wicked wheels send you diving, I hate underwater ghost stories.
“Finally, as I’m sure you’re all well aware, completion of the off ramp expansion for exit six on US nine is more than a month behind schedule. Daytime news has kept us all very informed, I won’t waste essence imitating inferiors. Just stay mindful if you drift that way.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Alright.”
The voice continued.
“Next up, warning signs.”
Another variation on the jingle played.
“Right. Let’s not linger here. Caught some rumors, no confirmations. But. Narrow margins say we’ve sighted the Mesonoxian already.”
The voice allowed the silence to linger.
Binyelum exhaled slowly.
Another version of the jingle played.
“That’s the latest push for now, little bedlights. Keep it bright out there. Dr. Satelleyez, at your service. I’m your twilight jockey, a shooting star to light your way, by your side ‘til the bitter end, right here on one-four-oh dot-one-five NSE. ”
A final, longer version of the jingle played to usher out the doctor.
Silence followed.
Velocity said, “We rolled a boring one.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“We’ve got a first hour Mesonoxian sighting.”
Velocity made a face.
“Unconfirmed.”
Oren said, “Silhouette Entropy is interesting.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Silhouette Entropy is very interesting.”
They paused.
“I wonder who’s running the scene. What are they doing to pull enough special ones together to form an entirely new gang?”
Nancy gestured as though jerking someone off.
What?!
Wow.
Okay.
Everyone stared at Nancy.
Binyelum burst into laughter.
“I’m joining Nancy’s cult.”
Oh what the hell.
Jhansi’s stomach tightened.
She scowled.
“What the hell was that anyway?”
Everyone raised their eyebrows at her.
She probably hadn’t controlled her tone very well.
Sebastian said, “You’re unfamiliar with the application of pleasure?”
What?!
Jhansi went red.
She shook her hands.
“That’s not what I meant!”
Sebastian shrugged.
Binyelum laughed.
Great.
Jhansi scowled.
Binyelum said, “What was what, princess?”
Ugh.
A fucking rescue.
Gross.
Jhansi gestured.
“The radio person.”
Oren nodded.
“Right.”
He grabbed Jhansi’s wrist.
His grip felt surprisingly warm.
Oren squeezed.
“Someone’s using their gift to disseminate information.”
Velocity giggled.
“Seminate.”
Jhansi’s entire body went red.
Binyelum said, “More than likely it's a network of someones.”
Oren made a face, but didn't say anything.
Sebastian smirked at Jhansi.
“C’mon, you could've at least put that one together.”
Ugh.
Fuck off.
What would prove how much Jhansi had actually internalized?
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“How do we know we can trust them?”
Sebastian laughed.
“Nice trying, latecomer.”
Velocity giggled again.
“Better than prejac.”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
Sebastian blinked too.
“Wow.”
Mambele passed around another roundabout, this one illuminated by a dark magenta nebulite.
Binyelum said, “Alright, we’re getting close.”
Velocity giggled yet again.
“Getting close.”
Bineylum smirked at them in the mirror.
“You took the bait.”
Velocity slapped their forehead.
“Fuck! My points!”
Jhansi looked around.
“Close?”
Binyelum snorted.
They looked at Jhansi in the rearview mirror.
“To Bridgemall.”
Oh.
Oh.
Right.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
They had more to do.
Jhansi looked toward Binyelum.
Binyelum continued.
“Hard to say what it’s gonna be like in there. If they’re still around, we’ll need to get in and out as quickly as possible. If they’re gone, we’ll have to figure out where they went.”
Fuck.
The dangling corpse of Pooh Bear appeared again in Jhansi’s mind.
She wouldn't hate it if the endlings had already left.
Binyelum gestured.
“The memory I pulled didn't depict anything outranking green.”
They looked around.
“Anyone see different?”
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum nodded.
“Cool.”
They tightened their grip on the steering wheel.
“Though, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything.”
They paused.
“Anybody see any guards posted?”
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum frowned.
“Annoying.”
They paused.
“We should still assume there are guards.”
They paused again.
“Everyone’s familiar with Bridgemall, right?”
Nobody disagreed.
Bineylum nodded.
“Cool. Seems likely we'll find guards positioned near the entrance to the parking lot; on top of those two parking structures; and right outside the entryway.”
Jhansi pictured the approach to Bridgemall.
The long, flat plane of a parking lot preceded both the mall’s north and south entryways. A median planted with twisting trees bisected each lot. A four-story parking structure flanked both the east and west side of each entrance.
Jhansi had only a single memory of her parents parking at the top of one of those structures.
She had held tight to a steel railing warmed by the summer sun and leaned forward, not quite over the edge of the structure, captivated by the sparkling ribbon of water below, and by the dark line of the mall’s shadow wavering on the river’s surface. 
Binyelum continued.
“We should expect at least one moving patrol, too.”
They paused.
“Unless anybody has any better ideas, I’m gonna park in the drainage ditch between the avenue and the parking lot.”
Nobody spoke.
Bineylum nodded.
“Cool. We're not really a team built for stealth kills, so let's focus on getting in clean.”
They paused.
Oren spoke before they could continue.
“We could lure the green endling out into the parking lot?”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“That's not a bad idea, but–”
They shook their head.
“–they’d probably just send out the lower ranks to deal with us. We’d have to kill all of them.”
They paused.
“We might actually be able to pull that off.”
They paused again.
“But I’d rather not risk it.”
Oren shrugged.
Nobody argued.
Binyelum continued.
“We’ll probably have to kill the guards right at the entrance.”
They paused.
“Nancy and I will take point on that.”
Nancy nodded.
Oren said, “Nancy?”
Binyelum blinked.
They glanced over their shoulder.
“Why not?”
Oren made a face.
He shrugged.
Binyelum stared at the road.
Nobody spoke.
What the hell?
Bineylum glanced at Sebastian.
“Sebastian, you hang back with Velocity. Only heal us if we absolutely need it.”
They paused.
“Or if I tell you.”
Sebastian and Velocity looked at each other.
Sebastian shrugged.
Velocity nodded.
Bineylum glanced at Oren.
Oren raised both hands.
“Yeah, yeah, my gift’s the wrong fit for sneaking missions.”
Binyelum stared at him in the rearview mirror.
“A model team player.”
They paused.
Their hands tightened on the steering wheel.
“The agreement is important here.”
Double what the hell?
Oren blinked.
He made a face.
He looked away.
Then looked back at Binyelum.
“Why would I have forgotten?”
Binyelum made a different face.
They looked back toward the road.
Triple what the hell did all of that mean?
Jhansi leaned forward.
Oren looked at her.
Binyelum raised their eyebrows.
Jhansi said, “What the hell, guys?”
She looked from Oren to Binyelum.
“What about me?”
Oren rolled his eyes.
Binyelum blinked.
They chuckled.
“You forgot already?”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
“Forgot what?”
Binyelum gave an exaggerated sigh.
They waved a hand.
“Hang on, princess.”
Wait!
Forgot what?
Jhansi huffed.
She sat back in Oren’s lap.
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum shook their head once.
They continued.
“My memory only confirmed endlings posted in the food court. Can anybody else confirm endlings posted elsewhere inside?”
Nobody spoke.
Bineylum frowned.
“Frustrating. That doesn’t mean anything, but maybe we’ll get lucky.”
They paused.
“Once we’re inside, we’ll pass the first spiral staircase and make our way to the top floor at the next escalator. If we find any guards, we’ll probably have to kill them, but I really don’t want to leave too many corpses around. Regardless of what happens, the goal is to get to the top floor, then the food court. From there–”
Oren interrupted.
“What if they try to trap us on the top floor?”
Binyelum looked at him in the rearview mirror.
They paused.
For a long moment.
They spoke evenly.
“The green guy will probably be on top, and I don’t want to deal with how many guards will be posted near the stairs and escalators closest to the food court.”
Oren shrugged.
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“Once we get close enough to the green endling, Velocity, share your gift with Oren, to send Nancy and I directly to the target. They’ll be on high alert as soon as Oren’s gift takes effect, but if we’re lucky, we’ll be able to catch the target–”
Velocity interrupted.
“Tango.”
Binyelum blinked.
“What?”
Velocity gestured.
“Target sounds lame and boring. Call it the Tango.”
Oren blinked at them.
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
Velocity shrugged.
“It sounds cool.”
Binylum rubbed their forehead.
They sighed.
“Unfortunately it does sound cool.”
Velocity pumped their fist.
“Yeah!”
Ugh.
Binyelum continued.
“If we’re lucky, we’ll catch the Tango completely off guard, and Nancy can take it down with her ax. If not, I’ll share my gift with Nancy, and that will take care of it.”
A guaranteed KO?
Binyelum looked at Sebastian again.
“At that point, Nancy will need healing.”
What?
Binyelum continued.
“Velocity–”
They paused.
“Velocity, how fast is your recharge?”
Velocity shrugged.
They mimed dusting off their shoulders.
“Pretty fast.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Of course.”
Velocity grinned.
Binyelum continued.
“Alright. If Nancy needs healing, Velocity, you share your gift with Sebastian as soon as you can, or do whatever will get Nancy healed the quickest. The rest of you start making your way toward Nancy and I. Regardless of what it looks like. I’ll grab the green endling’s memory card. We’ll all meet up and kill our way out. I will probably have to share my gift with Nancy again. Hopefully we’ll have the memory cards on hand to shortcut Sebastian’s recharge, and we can heal Nancy right away.”	
They paused.
“I’ll take point, and responsibility, if the plan needs to change.”
They paused again.
“Everybody got it?”
Holy shit.
Jhansi blinked.
She hardly understood any of that, but it sounded really cool.
Binyelum turned a knob on the dashboard and Mambele’s headlights flicked off.
The cloak enveloped the sedan almost entirely, limiting visibility to less than a meter.
Binyelum didn’t slow down.
Jhansi stared at them.
She shook her head.
“What about me?”
Binyelum looked at her in the rearview mirror.
“Right.”
They paused.
“Princess, your job is to retrieve as many memory cards as possible.”
Oh.
Shit.
Right.
Fuck.
The Honey Pot flashed before Jhansi’s eyes.
“Right.”
Binyelum smiled.
They looked back at the dark road.
“How many shares does everyone have? How’s your refractory and recharge?”
Velocity snorted.
“Isn’t that kinda private?”
Binyelum raised their eyebrows in the rearview mirror.
“What? I just wanna get to know you.”
Velocity snorted again.
Binyelum nodded.
“C’mon.”
Everyone with a gift replied.
“Sixteen! Quick, quick!”
“Three. Slow, mid.”
“Six. Mid, mid.”
Nancy held up one finger, then shrugged.
Binyelum laughed.
“Let’s try that again.”
They paused.
“Oren?”
“Six. Mid, mid.”
“Reliable. Velocity?”
“Sixteen. Quick, quick.”
“Nice. Sebastian?”
“Three. Slow, mid.”
“Healthy. And I’ve got two.”
They paused.
Hey!
What about that other stuff?
Binyelum looked at Jhansi in the rearview mirror.
Oh shit.
They said, “Remember. Focus on collecting memory cards. We’re going to need them. Nancy and I will be out front; that's way too dangerous for you. Keep near Oren, Velocity, and Sebastian. Especially Oren. As soon as an endling goes down, grab its memory card.”
They paused.
“That was good thinking, grabbing that bag.”
Jhansi blushed.
Binyelum continued.
“Don’t fall too far behind.”
Jhansi made a face.
“I’m not gonna fall behind!”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They continued.
“Listen for whoever needs a recharge, and prioritize delivery over acquisition. It’ll be up to you to determine who gets the next card, so pay attention to what’s going on. Try to memorize how many shares everyone has, and don’t forget, someone might need a memory card to shortcut their refractory period, even if they’re not out of shares.”
They paused.
They smiled.
“Do your best to make sure everybody stays alive.”
Fuck.
Holy fuck.
Binyelum continued.
“Try to keep track of which memory cards came from which endlings, it’ll help inform your decision making. It’s impossible to tell how many shares are within any given memory card, but memory cards from higher ranking enemies generally impart more shares.”
Barely keeping up, but okay.
Binyelum continued.
“Also, Velocity’s gift will use up one of the recipient's shares, plus a variable number of their own, depending on how many special ones are hit.”
For fuck’s sake.
Bineylum nodded.
“Did you get all that?”
Fuck.
Could she really manage all that?
Well.
How would it feel, watching the Asterlings walk off into the cloak without her?
She had to do it.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Yeah, I got it.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Good girl.”
What?!
Jhansi blinked wide.
Binyelum’s grin lit up the cabin.
They shook their head.
“But seriously.”
They stared.
“Do you have any questions?”
Uh.
Jhansi pursed her lips.
“What about the new-game-plus?”
Binyelum paused.
They cocked their head.
“I don’t really think you’ll have time for that. But–”
They cocked their head to the other side.
“–if you collect six memory cards to keep in reserve, you can start new-game-plus’ing. And–”
They cocked their head back across their shoulders.
“–you’ll get a new title.”
Special recognition?
Jhansi beamed.
“Fuck yeah!”
She crossed her arms.
“The princess takes the throne.”
Bineylum stared at her.
They smiled.
“We’ll see.”
They paused.
“We’re here.”
Wait.
Holy fuck.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Wait!
Binyelum pulled Mambele gently to the right. Jhansi bounced in Oren's lap as the sedan mounted the curb, then trundled down into the wide, shallow ditch. Binyelum squeezed the clutch trigger and tapped several buttons on the shifter display, putting Mambele in park. They turned off the ignition and pocketed the key. The engine bells quieted.
Binyelum grabbed the door handle.
“Here we go.”
The door clicked open.
Bineylum stood and popped the seat forward, then popped the trunk. Nancy got out and popped the seat forward for Sebastian. Sebastian pushed himself out, and Velocity followed. They left the door open.
Oren looked up at Jhansi.
He made a face.
“C’mon, princess.”
Jhansi blinked.
She stood and stepped into the night.
A cold breeze pressed against her.
Her skirt whipped across her legs.
It hadn’t felt like this earlier.
Even on top of the Washington Square Tower.
Maybe because of their proximity to the river?
Oren climbed from the back seat and left the door open.
Sebastian retrieved his barbell from the trunk and left the latch open.
Jhansi looked around.
She couldn’t see shit.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched the fire extinguisher to her chest.
C’mon.
Really?
Jhansi flushed.
She awkwardly thrust her arms down by her sides.
Binyelum crouched, motioning for everyone to follow.
Everyone obeyed.
Jhansi almost fell on her ass in the mud.
Stupid.
Why did they have to crouch anyway?
Who the hell could possibly see them?
Bineylum grabbed a handful of mud and smeared it along the golden blade of their machete.
They looked at everyone.
Everyone copied Binyelum, dulling the gleam of their weapons.
Seriously?
Reflected light, in the netherlume shift?
For fuck's sake, they could probably just walk right up to the entryway.
Bineylum stared at Jhansi.
What?
Oh.
Shit.
Jhansi smeared mud on her fire extinguisher.
Gross.
Bineylum nodded.
They crawled on their stomach up the side of the ditch, then peeked over the lip.
Crawling through mud.
Great.
Binyelum looked back and waved.
They stood back into a crouch and headed up over the lip of the ditch.
Everyone followed in a cluster, with Nancy leading.
Well.
Okay.
No crawling through mud.
But.
Jhansi had a hard time staying upright on the incline.
The mud sucked at her flats.
She fell forward.
She caught herself with one hand, the mud splashing up into her face.
Fucking gross.
Jhansi held the fire extinguisher tight against her chest and climbed upward.
Her elbow banged against a rock.
Shit.
A long hiss escaped from between Jhansi’s teeth.
Crawling through mud after all.
Jhansi mounted the lip of the ditch.
The hard line of the parking lot cut through the frail grass a dozen meters ahead.
The space beyond could have reached to the horizon.
Jhansi couldn’t see shit.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched the fire extinguisher to her chest.
The Asterlings pressed forward without a sound.
An emerald green nebulite glow swelled at the far end of Jhansi’s vision.
The chroma had a deep, rich quality, but not much penetrating power.
The vague silhouette of both parking structures emerged from the cloak, framing the glow.
So the glow came from within the mall.
Binyelum paused.
Did an ear on their headband just twitch?
Binyelum said, “Something’s not right.”
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi clutched tighter to her muddy fire extinguisher.
Double fuck.
How fucking long would it take to reach the entryway?
They had nowhere to fucking run or hide.
Binyelum moved quickly.
Everyone kept up.
Jhansi stood slightly out of her crouch as she moved.
The parking lot dragged past on all sides.
Something dark and towering manifested from the cloak.
It reared above Binyelum, reaching skyward with a massive fist already screaming downward to splatter the teen against the pavement.
Wait.
What?
Fuck.
No.
A tree, planted in a median.
Jhansi nearly tripped over the cement barrier.
Stupid.
Fucking.
Bullshit.
Binyelum reached the parking structure and crouched low against the wall.
They peered over the wall, into the void of the structure.
They shook their head.
They looked back at everyone, then hurried along the length of the wall to the west, toward the entryway.
Everyone followed.
Jhansi squished herself down as far as she could.
Her legs started to ache.
Binyelum paused at the corner of the parking structure, leaned around it, and swore quietly.
“Pej.”
They leapt up.
What?
They looked around once, then pelted forward.
What the hell?
Everyone followed.
Somewhere nearby, endling patrols watched for special ones to murder.
Fuck.
Jhansi squeezed her fire extinguisher as she ran.
She stepped up a short stairway onto a cement walk.
A three-story facade loomed from the cloak, seven meters of dark stone atop three and a half meters of marble.
Heavy letters glared down at Jhansi.
BRIDGEMALL
They swooped up and back down, suggesting the shape of a bridge.
Green light poured from behind the glass entryway doors.
Two piles of pink meat and parted bone framed the entryway.
Oh.
Fuck.
White stuff oozed in spurts from the viscera.
Splashes of orange blood dripped from the marble walls and glass entryway doors.
The meat had something mixed in with it.
Slate gray fabric.
Bineyum paused in front of the rightmost pile.
A smashed eyeball stared at Jhansi.
She couldn't help but stare back.
Other details came into focus.
Gleaming teeth, protruding from a shattered jaw.
A long, slimey rope of intestines.
A slurry of assorted organs.
Jhansi retched.
Binyelum examined the meat, then looked at the Asterlings, then looked into the dark green interior of Bridgemall.
“They’re fighting in there.”
What?
Oren nodded.
“Yeah.”
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“Who’s fighting?”
Binyelum gave her a look.
“Endlings.”
Oh.
Shit.
Really?
Sebastian said, “We could just wait until they kill each other?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“We should watch. We’ll be fucked if the Tango dies and these other guys offer up that memory card.”
Sebastian sighed.
Binyelum looked at everyone.
“Let’s go.”
They pulled on the handle of a manual door.
It swung open easily.
Jhansi marveled that the endlings hadn’t battered it down.
The Asterlings squeezed through into the vestibule.
The hard carpet squeaked beneath Jhansi’s flats.
They passed through a second set of glass doors into the long chamber of the mall.
Inhuman screams of distant violence echoed toward them, interspersed with droning killchimes.
Jhansi swallowed.
A wide, spiraling staircase wound upward to her left.
Above her hung a constellation of spiraling ceramic stalactite sculptures, smooth edges catching and holding the ambient green light in bright curving bands.
Elevated crossways placed at uneven intervals connected the second and third mezzanines across the gap.
The chamber receded into the distance.
Benches, kiosks, stairways, and escalators obscured the view.
A hint of the ice rink shimmered ahead of them.
Bineylum gestured into the mall.
“We’ll stick to the plan as best we can. I’ll call out any changes.”
They directed the Asterlings forward along the left wall, not at a full sprint, but close.
The soles of their shoes clacked against the marble floor.
They passed an Auntie Anne’s Pretzels.
Then a shuttered optometrist’s office.
Then a Zumiez.
The shadowed merchandise beyond the lowered gate seemed to belong to a different world.
Did that mannequin just move?
They neared an escalator leading up to the second floor mezzanine.
A corpse sprawled heavily over the railing.
A blue endling, wearing a black uniform.
Its head stared upside-down from the floor.
The rest of the body remained intact.
The white shock of the monster’s severed spine winked at Jhansi.
Jhansi looked away.
Where had she seen a black uniform, anyway?
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
“Does this have to do with that eviscerated endling on the roundabout?”
Bineylum turned to her.
They looked upset.
“What eviscerated endling?”
They paused.
“What roundabout?”
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked.
She gestured.
“I dunno.”
She gestured again.
“Some endlings on some roundabout. They wore black uniforms.”
She shrugged.
“It looked like they were eating another endling.”
Binyelum didn’t reply.
They flattened their mouth into a straight line.
Shit.
Fuck.
Jhansi’s chest tightened.
Static crackled around the perimeter of her interior space.
She glanced at the other Asterlings.
Everyone looked upset.
A piercing shriek rushed through the chamber.
Binyelum said, “I didn’t see anything like that.”
Okay?
Jhansi flushed.
“Oh.”
Binyelum kept staring at her.
“Why didn’t you say something?”
A whiplash of static rang through Jhansi’s interior space.
“I thought you saw.”
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“I didn’t.”
The static again.
Sebastian flared his nostrils.
“See?”
He looked around.
“I don’t fucking trust her.”
Oh come on.
Jhansi glared at Sebastian.
“What the fuck, man?”
Velocity firmly shoved Sebastian.
“You really still think princess is a bad guy?”
Sebastian gestured.
“She could be leading us into a trap!”
Oh double come on!
Fucking seriously?
Jhansi flailed.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
Binyelum waved a hand.
“Shut up.”
They shook their head.
“We have to do this either way.”
They gestured up the escalator.
“C’mon.”
They hopped the small gate and pelted up the inert stairs.
Sebastian glowered at Jhansi.
Jhansi sneered back.
Everyone followed Binyelum.
Jhansi couldn’t quite mount the gate.
She growled at herself, shoved it out of the way, and hurried after the Asterlings.
They switched back onto a different escalator and continued to the third floor.
A light fixture hung suspended alongside the second escalator.
The colorful branding of a rentable third space greeted Jhansi as she stepped onto the third floor.
The Asterlings ran on.
The pristine, eerie eye of the ice skating rink watched from below as their shadows bucked along the ceiling.
A brighter light flickered further on.
The food court.
Articulate shapes clashed against the light.
Bodies in combat.
They passed a hexagonal alcove of glass elevators situated along the exterior wall, each lift a portal to the outside.
Darkness swelled in vertical lines.
Binyelum slowed and crouched.
They gestured at everyone, then pointed toward the food court.
Jhansi followed their lead.
She scooted closer to Binyelum.
“I’m sorry.”
Binyelum didn’t look at her.
“I said shut up.”
They moved forward.
Everyone followed.
More spiraling sculptures hung above the food court, their corkscrew silhouettes smeared across the glass dome void. Twin stairways looped in wide arcs downward around the space, connecting all three stories. Escalators offered quicker conveyance. Tables and chairs littered the scene, some overturned, others completely obliterated.
Each glass shelf hung gemlike in the green nebulite, crystalline to invisibility save for the violent reflections surging across every surface.
Blue and red endlings in slate gray and black uniforms lunged at each other, grappling, snarling, spitting, cleaving flesh, crushing limbs, snapping off body parts, grimacing with manic delight at each new ruined form. 
Corpses lay everywhere, frozen totems of terror suspended a hundred meters above the river’s dark water.
In the center of the second floor glass shelf a purple endling in a black uniform watched a green endling in a slate gray uniform kill a red endling.
The green endling turned to face the purple endling.
Binyelum chewed their lip.
“Shit.”
They crouched along the mezzanine railing and peered out to watch.
Everyone followed their lead.
Jhansi gripped the railing reflexively, squeezing it every time a howl of pain rose above the violence.
The green endling circled around its opponent.
The green endling …
What the fuck?
In place of a head, a muscular, prehensile appendage grew from the monster’s neck. A gleaming claw extruded from the swollen tip. The appendage undulated. It whipped against the air, snapping loud enough for Jhansi to hear. The claw flashed bright.
The mouth on the monster’s stomach opened wide, teeth and tusks pistoning apart.
A roar filled the chamber.
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
The endling’s jaws slammed shut.
Light flashed across the pair of eyes glaring from the monster’s chest, pinprick pupils hardening in the afterglow.
The monster huffed through flared nostrils.
It growled low.
The Tango.
The purple endling stood unmoving, even as its opponent circled.
Two pointed, bony plates jutted in parallel from the monster’s collarbone, with more trailing down to diminish and converge along the monster’s back.
A spray of thick flagella sprouted from between the largest two plates. Some of the appendages rolled down its back. Some stood coiled, turning to follow the green endling.
Sensory organs?
Thin barbs glistened on the end of each.
Poisonous sensory organs?
A tusked mouth lined with bladed teeth gaped from both sides of the endling's body. A muscular arm ending in a clawed hand sprouted from each throat, along with a clawed prehensile appendage. Saliva dribbled in a perpetual stream from both open orifices.
Two arms.
Two whips.
And that bundle of flagella.
The advantage seemed pretty obvious.
The monster left its arms and whips hanging loosely by its side.
Cocky much?
The eyes on the monster’s chest narrowed.
Fat lips peeled back from the x-shaped mouth on its stomach.
The lines of the mouth split open, retracting to expose consummate jaws lined with teeth that curved to razor points.
The jaws parted.
A long, bright red tongue lolled out.
Longer.
And longer.
A taunt?
Unreal.
Both monsters wore uniforms perfectly tailored to fit their grotesque forms.
Fascinating.
Binyelum’s eyes narrowed.
“Hm.”
Velocity hissed, “Shit. Tango v. Fandango.”
Jhansi gave them a look.
Velocity continued.
“This one looks pretty one-sided, boys, but a show’s a show! Place yer bets!”
Jhansi gave them a different look.
The Tango rushed.
Heavy boots hammered against glass.
The monster’s whip-like appendage trailed behind it.
The Fandango remained unmoving.
It tensed its coiled flagella.
The Tango stepped into range.
The Fandango struck, spiraling its flagella around each other to mimic a single limb, every barb converging to the same point.
Velocity hissed, “Spiral cannon!”
Jhansi gave them yet another look.
Binyelum glanced at them too.
The Tango crashed to a halt on all fours.
It lashed with its clawed whip, throwing the organ in a tight arc toward the bunched up flagella.
Light winked off the lethal edge.
The flagella dispersed, pulling back in a semicircular halo.
The Fandango finally turned.
It threw both whips toward the Tango's slashing appendage.
The Tango had already begun to reach upward with one hand.
It grabbed its own whip and yanked downward.
The Fandango’s strike missed by degrees.
The Tango’s whip smashed against the floor.
Jhansi winced.
Velocity hissed, “Collateral damage.”
Oren whispered, “I don’t think that’s how that word works.”
Sebastian gave him a look.
“Yes it is.”
The Fandango corrected the trajectory of its strike, angling both claws to stab down into the Tango's back.
The Tango rolled to the right.
The Fandango’s claws ricocheted off the glass.
The Tango's whip slashed across the Fandango's left thigh.
Muscle separated.
Orange blood fountained.
The dark shape murmured.
Velocity hissed, “First point!”
A small smile spread on Binyelum’s face.
The Fandango roared.
It charged forward, ignoring the wound.
The Tango used all five limbs to push itself forward, past the Fandango.
The Fandango lurched, swinging hard.
It missed.
The Tango righted itself.
Both monsters squared off again.
Velocity hissed, “And a reset!”
Bineylum vibrated.
The Fandago huffed.
It narrowed its eyes.
Its tongue lolled forward, nearly touching the glass, and flicked across its wounded thigh.
It swallowed its own blood.
Jhansi made a face.
The Fandango took a step forward.
It swung its left whip diagonally against the glass.
It swung its right whip too, before the first movement had fully concluded.
And then its left.
And then its right.
The pattern continued, picking up speed.
Three flagella stabbed forward through each brief interstice, with three others settling into position to follow behind.
Velocity hissed, “The Goodnight Combine!”
The Fandango advanced.
The Tango narrowed its eyes.
It circled.
The Fandango followed.
Claws battered against and screeched across the glass.
The Tango stepped over the nearby red endling corpse.
The Fandango followed.
The whirling combine of claws carved into the body.
Orange blood and white stuff sprayed.
Slabs of meat slid across the glass.
Woof.
The Fandango stepped onto the mutilated remains.
The Tango lunged.
The Fandango threw its limbs wide.
Light flickered along the razor edges of its myriad claws.
The clawed whips and the bundle of flagella curved in a parabola around the approaching Tango, driving in toward it from both sides and above.
Velocity hissed, “Into a textbook Death Adder!”
The Tango struck forward with its whip.
The Fandango caught the appendage with one hand, and then the other.
Claws and barbs rushed down to skewer the Tango.
The Tango let its feet fall out from under it.
It slashed at its own whip with its right hand.
Muscle and bone severed cleanly.
A spray of orange blood twinkled in air where the incoming claws struck.
Everyone gasped.
The dark shape said, {“I’d like to see you do that.”}
Jhansi said, {“What the fuck?”}
The Tango passed beneath the attack by degrees.
It hit the glass, tucked, and launched itself out of reach, galloping on all fours then stopping hard to right itself.
It turned, hammering on the glass.
Holy shit.
Velocity hissed, “Escape on the razor’s edge!”
A snarl warped the Fandango’s face.
The Fandango squeezed the Tango’s whip with both hands, pumping out a surge of blood that splashed onto the floor, then grabbed the severed end of it.
The Tango watched.
The Fandango’s lips and jaws parted.
Saliva dripped in the field of its teeth.
It pulled the Tango’s whip into its mouth.
And bit down.
Teeth punched through muscle.
The Fandango’s lips wrapped around the organ.
It sucked the meat off the bone.
It chewed.
And swallowed.
Orange blood ran down the front of its uniform.
Wow.
The dark shape said, {“Picture it in your mouth.”}
Jhansi said, {“What the fuck?!”}
The Fandango snarled again.
It tossed aside the appendage.
It smashed its left whip against the glass.
Then its right.
The pattern resumed.
Velocity hissed, “Another Goodnight Combine!”
The Fandango advanced.
The Tango flexed its hands.
It began to circle.
Blood dribbled across its eyes.
The Fandango drew closer.
The Tango panted.
The Fandango drew closer.
The Tango blinked.
The Fandango lurched forward.
Velocity hissed, “On the offensive!”
Claws and barbs flickered.
The Tango stumbled back.
It reached with its left hand.
It grabbed a dining table.
Dark claws pierced through splintering wood.
The Tango brought the dining table screaming through the air.
The underside of the table hit the Fandango’s flailing limbs with explosive force.
Orange blood fountained.
Everyone gasped.
Velocity said, “Full reversal!”
The Fandango reached an arm forward.
The Tango took a step.
It adjusted its grip, grabbing the dining table by the stand.
With both hands.
It tensed, veins bulging.
It swung the dining table upward, battering it against the Fandango’s outstretched arm.
Orange blood fountained.
Velocity shook their fists.
“Walk-Off Grand Slam!”
The Tango took another step.
It stood face to face with the Fandango.
It thrust claws trailing afterimages into and around the Fandango’s eyes.
Bone separated.
The Tango’s claws flashed killcolors.
The Fandango’s eyes emptied.
Its limbs fell.
The Tango screamed in the corpse’s face.
It kicked the body to the ground.
Velocity whisper shouted, “And the crowd goes fucking wild!”
The dark shape said, {“Think you could scream like that?”}
Jhansi said, {“What the fuck, man?”}
The Tango fell upon the corpse, dark claws forcing wide the narrow bleeding incisions they had made, exposing in a burst of gore the hollow of the body.
Ribs, plates of bone, fragments of unnatural anatomy jutted at odd angles.
The Tango plunged an open fist into the fissure.
It retrieved a fistful of organs dripping orange blood and stuff.
It held the mess up with an open palm.
The offering began to spin.
Faster and faster.
The viscera spiraled away.
A memory card whirled in space, hovering just above the green endling’s palm.
Images flickered, too fast for Jhansi to parse.
They coalesced into a hologram.
The darkened facade of the moon.
Light spread across the surface of the sphere and exploded into a pointed cross.
The memory card vanished.
Huh.
An offering.
Binyelum stood.
“That's our cue.”
Oren pointed down through the shelves of glass.
“Fuck.”
Three masked teenagers ran along the first floor of the chamber, aiming for an escalator at the other end of the food court.
One wore a full face diver’s mask and carried a spear-headed shovel; another wore a surgical mask and carried a chef’s knife; the last wore a conical knight’s helm and carried a sledgehammer.
The group maintained a tight formation.
Binyelum cursed.
“Pej.”
They ran.
“C’mon. Escalator. Down. Now.”
Nancy rushed to follow.
Oren charged behind, with Velocity trailing.
Sebastian scowled at Jhansi.
“Fucking go!”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She hurried ahead of Sebastian.
Oren rushed up past Nancy.
Strange.
On the mezzanine across from Jhansi, a blue endling in a black uniform grabbed the mouth of a downed endling in a slate gray uniform. The dominating endling used both hands to spread the hinge of the other monster’s jaw. Wider and wider. The brutalized endling thrashed. The winner kicked aside the loser's flailing hands. The loser’s skull snapped. Thick ropes of muscle split apart. Again. And again.
Killcolors flashed.
The top of the loser's head separated.
Orange blood and white stuff fountained.
Fuck.
The endling spit in the vacant eyes of the parted skull.
It shoved a hand into the corpse.
Gore sloshed from the cavity.
The endling retrieved and offered up the memory card.
It looked across the gulf of the chamber.
It noticed the Asterlings, dropped the skull, and charged along the mezzanine toward the food court.
Double fuck.
A crossway connected both mezzanines ahead of the food court.
Triple fuck.
An escalator connected the third and second floor a couple meters past the crossway.
Binyelum sprinted toward it.
Wait.
Should Jhansi say something?
She had gotten in trouble for keeping her mouth shut before.
Jhansi yelled, “Binyelum!”
Sebastian smacked her shoulder.
“You fucking asshole!”
Jhansi glared at him.
She made a face and pointed across the gulf of the chamber.
Sebastian just glowered.
Oren, Velocity, and Nancy glanced at Jhansi.
Binyelum shook their head.
“I know.”
Oren charged out ahead of Binyelum.
His Nikes hammered against the marble tiles.
An indecipherable expression passed across Binyelum’s face.
They reached for Oren’s jacket, but missed.
Oren pulled ahead.
The endling noticed.
It lunged to gallop on all fours.
Binyelum blinked.
“Oren! What the hell!”
Oren shook his head.
“You guys head down the escalator. I’ll hold him off.”
Oren turned onto the crossway.
Binyelum ran harder.
“What the hell are you doing? Fucking dumbass, we need your gift!”
Oren passed the halfway point of the crossway as the endling turned toward him.
Binyelum reached the crossway.
They glanced over the edge, down through the food court to the first floor.
The trio of special ones rocketed near the escalator.
Two blue endlings blocked the way.
Dr. Chef lifted their surgeon’s mask with one hand and reached the other out behind themselves.
Scuba Scooper grabbed it.
Their diver’s mask pulsed and dimmed.
Dr. Chef retched.
They vomited up a spray of opaque turquoise light.
It fountained out of their mouth and spread through the air.
The light froze just as gravity took hold, locking the shape in place.
Reflections slid along the glowing, delicately angled edges.
Both blue endlings writhed, unable to break free of the substance.
The substance had caught the closer endling fully around the top of its torso and the bottom of its skull.
The tips of its tusks peeked out.
Could it breathe?
Its maniacally wide eyes and desperate attempts to smash away the substance offered some evidence toward an answer.
The other endling had lunged to the left, but the widening spray of the substance had caught it fully in the face and along its right shoulder.
The trio hurried on toward the escalator.
Binyelum balled their fists.
“Fucking pej.”
Oren barreled forward.
The endling reared back.
Taller and taller.
With flashing claws raised.
Oren froze.
“Fuck!”
Binyelum threw themselves down the crossway.
“Oren! What the fuck!”
Nancy looked back at everyone.
She nodded toward Binyelum.
Everyone ran to follow.
The claws came down.
Oren barely managed to knock them aside.
He fell back.
“Fuck!”
The endling snarled.
It slashed with its other hand.
Oren threw himself backward onto the floor.
Three claws caught him across the chest.
Red blood sprayed.
A lot of it.
What the fuck, Oren?
Binyelum shouted, “Oren!”
They passed a pendulous light hanging between the crossway and the food court.
Sebastian pulled ahead of Jhansi.
Jhansi’s chest pounded.
She worked to keep up.
The fire extinguisher banged against her breastbone.
She peered down the escalator as she ran onto the crossway.
A red endling in a slate grey uniform stalked up toward them.
A blue endling in a slate grey uniform followed.
Fuck.
Jhansi shouted, “There’s guys coming up!”
Sebastian yelled back, “Of course there’s guys coming up! You let every fucking endling in the mall know we’re here!”
Velocity glanced back at them.
“Shut the fuck up!”
They looked back down the crossway.
“Oren!”
Twin sets of menacing claws flashed through the air.
Oren screamed.
Blood splashed across his face.
Orange blood.
The endling staggered back, reaching toward the wound carved across its face.
And its missing eye.
Light winked off Binyelum’s machete.
They reached for Oren’s hand.
A look passed across their face.
The endling swung at them.
Nancy’s ax had already started moving.
The endling’s severed hand spiraled through the air.
The monster screamed.
Velocity shouted, “Move!”
Binyelum dragged Oren to the side.
Blood spilled down his chest.
He coughed.
Velocity charged past.
They fell hard onto one knee, beneath the endling’s flailing arm.
They brought their bat blistering upward.
It connected with the endling’s jaw.
The endling’s head whipped back.
Nancy’s killcolored ax swung upward to follow.
The monster’s jaw and neck split wide.
A killchime rang.
Holy shit.
Binyelum glared at Sebastian.
“Sebastian!”
Sebastian panted.
He hurried past the hanging light.
He stretched his right arm forward.
Binyelum grabbed Oren’s wrist and held it out toward Sebastian.
Oh shit.
Hang on.
Wait.
Everyone’s body language.
Wait.
This looked really bad!
Jhansi shouted, “Oren!”
Binyelum looked at her.
Their eyes went wide.
They let go of Oren’s wrist.
Sebastian cursed.
He jumped forward.
He grabbed Oren’s wrist.
Bineylum ran back down the crossway.
“Jhansi!”
Their face went dark.
“Run!”
Jhansi turned.
The red endling.
A deep jungle predator galloped on all fours toward her.
Its claws tore chunks from the marble tiles.
Its teeth parted.
Hot air rushed from its hungry throat.
The monster’s eyes held the certainty of her demise.
The understanding of just how much devastating physical power it packed into each explosive attack.
The unspoken, unnecessary consensus.
Jhansi could do nothing to stop it.
Static exploded around the perimeter of her interior space.
She froze.
Her mind screamed at her.
Not me!
She wet herself.
Not me not me not me!
Not once in her life had she seen anything as big as the endling that filled her vision.
Not me not me not me!
She fell to her knees.
Weak.
Helpless.
Pathetic.
The fundamental truth of her failure screamed toward Jhansi.
Static pierced through her from every direction.
She reeled, her mind empty.
Claws gleamed across the breadth of the world.
Solemn.
A ritual.
Validation for all that hatred.
A blistering, distorted pinch harmonic erupted through the chamber.
What?
A guitar cabinet appeared in midair above and behind the oncoming endling.
Something materialized in waveform streaks from the body of the cab.
Nancy.
Noise exploded.
The cab disintegrated.
Nancy hurtled down toward the endling, killcolored ax already in motion.
The blade connected with the back of the monster’s neck.
Orange blood sprayed.
The endling’s eyes shot wide.
A killchime rang.
It tumbled at Jhansi’s feet, spine neatly severed, blood already pooling in the new cavern above its shoulder blades.
Nancy landed in a roll, flattening herself atop the monster.
An impossibly long limb stretched above her.
Binyelum leapt over the girl and the corpse.
Light slid across their machete.
They pulled back and threw their weapon.
The blade arced end over end.
It sunk home in a flash of killcolors, driving deep between the oncoming blue endling’s eyes.
A killchime rang.
The monster crashed face first into the floor.
Nancy’s ax sang up and back down.
The red endling’s head burst away from its neck.
Binyelum and Nancy looked toward Jhansi.
Jhansi stared.
She blinked.
Binyelum reached out a hand.
“You’re alright.”
Not a question.
But.
Hard to ingest.
Jhansi blinked again.
Footsteps behind her.
She turned.
Everyone else.
The colors in Sebastian’s flower crown had returned.
So quickly?
Oren’s headphones had dimmed.
The other gift.
Oren!
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Binyelum clapped loudly.
Jhansi whipped back around.
Binyelum said, “Jhansi. Cards.”
Cards.
Cards?
An instruction?
Jhani blinked.
She reached into her canvas bag and grabbed the pack of playing cards.
She held them out to Binyelum.
“You saved me.”
Bineylum leaned forward and clapped at her again.
“Shock can wait. Grab the memory cards.”
Oh.
Oh!
Memory cards!
Oh holy shit.
Oh holy fucking shit.
Jhansi threw herself onto the corpse of the endling that had almost ended her life. A gush of orange blood and white stuff bubbled from the stump of its neck. Jhansi plunged her arm in deep. White stuff pumped out in spurts.
Jhansi searched deeper.
And deeper.
All the way to the hilt.
Until.
There.
Jhansi's hand found something hard. She grabbed it and yanked. White stuff sucked at her arm, slopping onto the floor as she pulled away.
Jhansi tried to shake off some of the gore.
The translucent body of the memory card flickered, filtering the color of the world through shades of muted digital green and gray.
Kaleidoscopic snapshot images flashed inside the card.
Jhansi couldn’t understand any of them.
The dark shape said, {“Feed.”}
Jhansi scowled.
She stuffed the memory card into her canvas bag and launched herself toward the blue endling’s corpse.
Binyelum stood from retrieving their machete.
They looked around.
Two red endlings in slate gray uniforms barreled toward the Asterlings from the third floor food court, each taking a different mezzanine.
Jhansi plunged her hand into the second body, her hand sinking deep between the monster’s eyes.
Binyelum looked down into the second floor food court.
“Pejudo lo anmo.”
They looked at everyone.
“Gotta move.”
They glared at Oren.
“Stay with Jhansi.”
Oren stared back with white, glassy features.
He nodded.
Binyelum pelted toward the escalator.
Nancy, Velocity, and Sebastian followed.
Jhansi pulled free another memory card and stuffed it into her canvas bag.
Viscera stained the fabric.
Oren pointed down the escalator.
Jhansi glanced at each of the oncoming endlings.
She ran.
Oren followed.
Jhansi flew down the escalator.
She spied the trio of special ones as they crested the escalator onto the second floor food court.
Two red endlings–one in a slate gray uniform, the other in a black uniform–closed in from different angles.
How would that play out?
The green endling stood in the center of the space.
It held the remnants of its severed appendage like a whip.
It glanced up toward the Asterlings.
Jhansi locked eyes with it.
The dark shape said, {“Imagine how that would feel.”}
Jhansi frowned.
{“What fucking part of it, asshole?”}
The ending snarled and turned away.
It glanced toward something Jhansi couldn’t see.
It cracked its whip and stalked toward the trio of special ones.
Binyelum pointed toward the trio.
“Velocity, Oren. Put ‘em through it.”
Oren paused for a single beat.
“You sure?”
Binyelum paused for another beat.
“Yes.”
Oren gave them a look.
A series of expressions passed quickly across his face.
Binyelum called over their shoulder.
“Jhansi. Card. Oren.”
Card?
Oren?
Memory card!
Oren!
Jhansi grabbed one from her bag and thrust it toward Oren.
Oren snatched it, crunched it three times, and swallowed.
His headphones blinked back to vibrancy.
He reached past Jhansi toward Velocity.
Velocity grabbed his hand.
“Duck!”
Binyelum and Nancy ducked.
Sebastian pulled Jhansi down.
Velocity’s astronaut helmet pulsed and dimmed.
Stars burst from Oren’s eyes.
They slowed in the friction of the air, shimmered in two lines, and dissipated as they drifted.
Stars speckled the trio of special ones fighting across the second floor food court.
Oren’s headphones pulsed and dimmed.
A chorus of searing pinch harmonics filled the chamber.
The trio of special ones disappeared.
Three cabs appeared in midair behind the two red endlings nearest them.
Two above the endling in the black uniform and the third above the other.
All three teenagers smeared into existence out from their respective cabs.
Noise exploded.
The trio rocketed downward.
Three endlings in black uniforms closed in on the Asterlings from the second floor.
Two blue from out in the food court and the other red from the mezzanine adjacent the escalator landing.
One of the red endlings up behind the Asterlings reached the top of the escalator.
Velocity yelled, “Dunno if that was the right call, boss!”
Binyelum fell to one knee on the escalator, just a few steps from the bottom.
They cupped their hands and held them up to Nancy.
Nancy stepped with one foot into Binyelum’s palms.
Binyelum launched her into the air.
The red endlings across the food court both spun around, searching with their claws for the disappeared special ones.
Neither knew to look up.
Scuba Scooper and Dr. Chef had appeared above the red endling in the black uniform.
They tumbled through the air.
Scuba Scooper oriented themselves well enough to bring their spear-headed shovel plunging down into the endling’s back, just below its shoulder blade.
The monster stumbled.
Dr. Chef collided bodily with its other shoulder and fell to the floor.
Their eyes flashed.
They pushed themselves upward.
Their right arm trusting, their hand holding a killcolored knife.
The blade sank deep into the endling’s throat.
A killchime sounded.
Blood and stuff sprayed Dr. Chef’s face.
The monster slumped forward.
Dr. Chef pulled their knife free of the corpse and let the body fall.
Meters away, Sir Whack-a-knight brought their sledgehammer down as hard as possible against their targeted endling’s skull.
Except, they misjudged the monster’s momentum.
The strike missed, shattering the endling’s collar bone.
The monster barked, buckling to one knee.
Ringing claws swung wide to grab at the special one.
Sir Whack-a-knight spilled clumsily off the endling’s shoulders.
The endling caught their right side, knocking them to the ground.
Red blood gushed from five curved lines.
The teenager screamed.
Nancy soared over the closest of the two oncoming blue endlings.
Both monsters tilted their heads to watch her fly.
The closest endling reared back to strike.
Binyelum nodded at Velocity.
Velocity stepped onto Binyelum’s palms.
Binyelum launched Velocity into the air.
They turned to Jhansi.
“Oren. Card.”
Velocity spun end over end, swinging their bat in a vertical arc.
The endling struck hard at Nancy.
Velocity’s bat connected with the back of its head.
It lurched.
The strike missed Nancy by degrees.
She touched down and swung her ax in a tight, killcolored semicircle.
The endling’s face exploded.
A killchime sounded.
Nancy twirled, ducking under the corpse.
The other endling’s wide swipe caught the dead body on the side.
Dark claws carved deep gashes, spilling orange blood and white stuff.
Nancy stumbled.
The endling did too.
Velocity leapt forward.
They landed on their knees.
Light flickered and whirled.
Velocity’s bat connected with the back of the monster’s bracing leg.
It toppled.
Binyelum pirouetted and brought their killcolored machete driving hard into the side of the endling’s skull.
The blade pierced outward through an eye socket.
A killchime sounded.
Oren grabbed the memory card from Jhansi’s outstretched hand, downed it, and reached past Jhansi to Sebastian.
He nodded at Jhansi to run.
His headphones pulsed and dimmed.
A screeching pinch harmonic exploded in Jhansi’s face.
Sebastian disappeared.
Jhansi took off.
Sebastian exploded from the midair cab that appeared behind the endling racing down the escalator.
The endling turned and reared to strike.
Oren caught the tensed arm with his chainlock.
Sebastian smashed his barbell into the center of the endling’s face.
It fell in a shower of orange blood, nearly crushing Oren.
Oren leapt off the escalator.
Sebastian rolled off the endling’s body, caught his barbell across the width of the escalator, and let momentum and gravity carry him the rest of the way down, stumbling at the last moment as the barbell slid off the handrails.
Bineylum glanced at Jhansi.
“Card. Oren.”
Jhansi plunged her arm into the nearest of the dead endlings.
Binyelum turned to Velocity and pointed toward the trio across the food court.
“Sebastian.”
Velocity gave them a strange look, then turned to Sebastian, grabbing his wrist and pulling him to his feet.
Binyelum nodded at Nancy, then turned to face the remaining endlings.
One red endling in a slate gray uniform storming down the escalator.
One red endling in a black uniform charging in from the second floor mezzanine.
Oren and Sebastian hadn’t killed the red endling now lying supine on the escalator, but it still seemed pretty much out of the action.
Velocity squeezed Sebastian’s wrist.
Their astronaut helmet pulsed and dimmed.
Stars burst from Sebastian’s eyes and shimmered across the special ones within his line of sight.
Velocity, Nancy, and the trio.
Petals burst from Sir Whack-a-knight’s split flesh.
Shit.
How many cards did Velocity have left now?
How did that even work?
Sir Whack-a-knight looked down at their side, then out into the food court.
They glared at the Asterlings.
The red endling threw a kick.
Scuba Scooper grabbed Dr. Chef’s hand and shared their gift.
Dr. Chef lifted their surgical mask and vomited up another streak of turquoise light.
The blast passed above Sir Whack-a-knight by degrees, reaching just far enough to catch the endling’s leg.
The monster snarled.
It let itself fall to the floor, flailing and grasping at Sir Whack-a-knight, its leg held suspended in midair.
Sir Whack-a-knight crabwalked away and struggled to their feet.
They reached for their sledgehammer.
The endling grabbed it first.
It heaved the weapon over the food court railing, down onto the first floor.
The crash reverberated.
Sir Whack-a-knight stared over the railing into empty air.
Dr. Chef shouted and reached toward Sir Whack-a-knight.
Sir Whack-a-knight turned and mirrored the gesture.
The green endling lunged, snapping its whip to intercept.
The severed limb rolled through the air, dark claw flashing.
Sir Whack-a-knight stumbled back.
Dr. Chef cursed.
The endling leered.
It took a heavy step forward, channeling the momentum into an overhead strike, the whip whistling toward Sir Whack-a-knight.
The red endling galloping down the second floor mezzanine turned the corner onto the food court and hurtled toward the Asterlings.
Binyelum looked at Velocity and Nancy.
They held up three fingers, then mimed something with both hands, slicing low with one hand and high with the other.
They held up two fingers, then one finger, then mimed again with both hands, banking them away from each other.
A look passed across Velocity’s face.
They nodded.
Nancy nodded.
They pelted toward the onrushing endling.
The downed red endling on the escalator stirred, grasping weakly for the handrails.
It grabbed hold just as the red endling charging down the escalator stepped hard onto its face.
Bone splintered.
Orange blood sprayed.
The monster’s shattered jaw tore free from its face, but not entirely.
Skin and sinew held it dangling in place.
The endling howled.
More orange blood sprayed.
Oren and Sebastian looked at each other.
Jhansi handed Oren a dripping memory card.
Oren stared at it.
He looked around, at Sebastian and Jhansi, the nearby corpses, the overturned tables and chairs, and the imminent enemy.
Oren stuffed the memory card into his mouth.
His headphones blinked back to vibrancy.
He grabbed Sesbastian’s hand.
His headphones pulsed and dimmed.
A pinch harmonic screamed.
The onrushing endling leapt over the side of the escalator.
It hung in air, arms spread, bright claws open wide.
It slipped from view.
Down toward the first floor.
Down into a mob of blue endlings.
A guitar cab appeared in midair above and behind the falling endling.
Oren’s eyes went wide.
“Pej!”
He ran toward the railing.
Sir Whack-a-knight threw themselves to the side.
The clawed whip glanced off their knight’s helm.
Hilarious.
Scuba Scooper grabbed Dr. Chef’s hand.
Again?
Did they ever run out?
Dr. Chef lifted their surgical mask and vomited up another stream of turquoise light.
It filled the space between Sir Whack-a-knight and the green endling.
The green endling snarled.
It whirled on Scuba Scooper and Dr. Chef.
Velocity and Nancy sprinted toward their targeted red endling.
Their shoes pounded against the glass.
Binyelum watched.
Velocity squeezed the handle of their bat, angling it downward.
They began to yell.
Binyelum watched.
Nancy pushed ahead deliberately, angling her ax slightly up.
She crouched into her run.
Binyelum watched.
The endling readied itself.
It struck, throwing both arms with bullet severity into Velocity and Nancy’s inevitable trajectories.
Binyelum launched their machete through the air.
Bands of golden light flickered.
Velocity and Nancy ducked to the side, bashing their weapons against both the endling’s grasping hands.
The endling roared.
Binyelum’s killcolored machete sunk deep between its eyes.
A killchime sounded.
The hovering guitar cab blasted Sebastian into existence.
He rocketed screaming down toward the mob of endlings below.
The monsters jumped, swiping with flashing claws.
One of them caught Sebastian through the shoulder.
It amplified his momentum and smashed his face against the floor.
Sebastian's head snapped back.
His eyes went dark.
Endlings fell upon the body, sinking claws through flesh and bone, pulling away limbs and devouring warm meat in a shower of red blood.
What?!
Wait.
No.
That didn't happen.
Fuck.
Oren’s chainlock spiraled out over the railing.
Sebastian grabbed hold with one hand.
He didn’t stop screaming.
His hand slid along the chainlock, catching on the weighted end.
Oren lurched forward, catching himself against the railing.
Sebastian swung sharply.
Light glinted off his barbell.
The red endling smashed onto the glass below.
It turned and swiped at Sebastian’s dangling weapon.
Oren pulled hard on his chainlock.
He glanced over his shoulder.
“Jhansi!”
Oh.
Shit.
Wait!
Jhansi ran over.
What should she do?
Oren pulled again.
Jhansi wrapped her hands around his waist and pulled.
Nancy and Binyelum appeared.
They reached over the railing, grabbed hold of Sebastian and hauled him up.
Oren fell back onto Jhansi.
Jhansi yelped.
Someone grabbed her wrist.
Velocity.
They heaved her up.
Oren too.
Their pendant glittered.
Jhansi blinked.
She looked around.
Red and blue endlings swarmed on every escalator leading up from the first floor.
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
“Uh.”
She looked toward the others.
“Guys?”
The green endling lurched.
Its whip carved a wide horizontal arc.
Scuba Scooper reached for Dr. Chef’s hand.
Fucking again?
The green endling had to see it coming.
The railing exploded.
Wait.
The green endling staggered.
What?
Shrapnel blossomed.
What the fuck?
A massive shape emerged.
Oh shit.
The enormous quadruped rose in slow motion, clearing the glass shelf, landing with its forepaws just beyond the spewed turquoise light.
The impact reverberated in Jhansi's teeth.
The endling trapped beneath the turquoise light scrambled.
A hindpaw came down and crushed its skull.
Orange blood, white stuff, and pink brains splattered the glass.
The alterling lifted the wide, protracted cylinder of its head.
A moaning howl resounded from far down its throat.
Calling prey inward.
Goosebumps prickled Jhansi’s skin.
The alterling had no other sensory organs that she could see.
Only the gaping mouth at the end of that long head.
The skin around the hole pulled back, revealing rows of teeth receding into darkness.
A slender tongue flicked out.
The howl continued.
Two circumferential indentations beneath the skin of the alterling’s head separated the organ into three parts, giving it a minimal degree of flexibility. 
The monster’s long, leathery tail cut the air, smashing away more of the railing.
Rigid quills bristled across its entire body.
It reared on its hind legs, to a height more than three meters, and came smashing down onto the floor.
Velocity whispered, “Cursed Tardigrade.”
A squelching percussion erupted behind Jhansi.
Followed by deranged screaming.
Jhansi turned.
On the first floor, surrounded by a widening hemisphere of other endlings, a red endling gave up its life to a second altering.
The endling lay supine and squealing, impaled and flailing beneath one of the alterling’s hindlimbs, its shoulder pierced by a shining raptor claw.
Both the alterling’s long legs ended in a nest of claws, razor edges curving in every direction.
The alterling’s spherical body sat high atop those legs, the dome of it nearly cresting the second floor glass shelf.
Interlocking plates of dark bone covered the flesh of the body.
A blue, translucent goo oozed from between the plates.
Viscous strands splattered in an uneven stream onto the floor.
A meaty, tubular appendage swung down from the body, pounding at the floor, sucking incessantly at the pooling goo, dragging a thin tongue along behind it.
Disgusting.
A thick wash of goo coated the impaled endling's legs.
The limbs began to foam.
The endling screamed, smashing its arms against the floor, its adversary, itself, splashing up flecks of goo.
The foaming turned to a roil.
The endling screamed louder.
Its legs dissolved, muscle and sinew and bone splattering into a slurry.
Pinkish bubbles drifted lazily into the air.
They popped.
The alterling’s snout slurped up the mess.
The monster lifted its foot off the tortured endling.
It leaned forward.
The orb of its body eclipsed what remained of its prey.
More goo swelled forth.
Some of it spewed down the endling's open throat.
The monster sizzled.
The screaming stopped.
The alterling’s pounding snout sucked it all down.
What.
The.
Fuck.
Jhansi retched.
Sebastian chuckled.
“Baba Yagoo.”
Oh gross!
Jhansi glared at him.
“That could have been you!”
Sebastian made a face.
“Excited much?”
What?!
Jhansi deepened her glare.
Baba Yagoo’s body flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors.
Wait, what?
A fresh wave of goo gushed onto the floor, thicker and stickier than before.
A new claw jutted from the alterling’s right leg.
Oh right.
It had consumed the endling’s memory card.
The Cursed Tardigrade tensed, raised its bristles, and struck with its tail.
Dr. Chef raised their arms in time, but Scuba Scooper didn't.
A quill pierced through Scuba Scooper’s diving mask.
Both special ones fell back hard, heads bouncing off the glass.
Red blood sprayed from around the quill protruding from Scuba Scooper’s head.
Ugh.
Again?
Another one?
All three streaks of turquoise light disappeared.
Wait.
What?
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh.
Fuck.
Oh!
Fuck!
A vice tightened around Jhansi's heart.
The dark shape laughed.
Sir Whack-a-knight scrambled toward Dr. Chef.
The green endling braced itself, gripped its whip with both hands, and swung for the Cursed Tardigrade.
The Cursed Tardigrade shifted.
Its quills punched outward, skewering the incoming whip.
The alterling pulled hard to the side, wrenching the whip free of the green endling's grip.
The quills retracted to their original length.
The severed organ hit the floor, pumping orange blood.
The green endling looked around.
Red and blue endlings in both colors of uniform poured up from the first floor, fleeing Baba Yagoo and charging the Cursed Tardigrade.
The green endling grinned.
It sneered at the Cursed Tardigrade.
It grabbed for an upended table.
The Cursed Tardigrade cocked its head.
Almost in an expression of curiosity.
The skin around the void of its mouth pulled back.
Almost in a mirror of the green endling's sneer.
The orifice widened, rows of teeth rotating.
Jhansi's chest tightened.
How could the hole get that big?
Something sinewy snapped.
Again.
Louder.
The entire cylinder of the Cursed Tardigrade's head thrust forward.
The space between the first two separate sections expanded, the skin stretching tight enough to expose bulging veins.
The green endling’s eyes sparkled.
The Cursed Tardigrade's mouth swallowed the green endling down to its waist.
The circle of teeth closed.
Orange blood sprayed.
The onrushing endlings hesitated.
Muffled screams filled the Cursed Tardigrade's maw.
The green endling writhed, trying to attack from within.
The Cursed Tardigrade braced itself.
It dragged the green endling along the floor, built momentum, and swung its head up and around in a long circular arc, lifting up its prey and smashing the monster down against the glass.
Something snapped.
The green endling's legs twitched, splayed at disturbing angles.
Louder screams echoed from within the Cursed Tardigrade.
The alterling shuddered.
The middle cylinder of its mouth constricted.
High pitched squealing replaced the screaming.
The Cursed Tardigrade squeezed harder.
The panicked pleading reached a frenzied peak.
The resistance of flesh and bone gave way.
The endling’s head yielded with a grinding crush.
A stream of orange blood and viscera spilled from between the alterling's teeth, splashing down the endling’s limp body.
The alterling shuddered again.
All three cylinders of its mouth worked in tandem, pulling apart the corpse and swallowing it down into the monster’s stomach.
Mess dribbled as it fed.
The Cursed Tardigrade's body flashed a kaleidoscopic grid of discordant colors.
Its tongue lashed out, now bladed with a claw at the end.
A similar claw protruded from the end of the alterling’s tail.
The endlings around the periphery continued to hesitate.
In a way, it made Jhansi feel better.
The Cursed Tardigrade turned toward the trio.
Binyelum shouted, “Nancy!”
They took off running without another word or gesture, blurring across the glass toward the Cursed Tardigrade.
Nancy kept pace.
Her face as static as ever.
Light dancing off her hardening eyes.
Bineylum shouted, “Velocity! Oren!”
Oren and Velocity slapped Sebastian on the back and charged together after Binyelum and Nancy.
Jhansi blinked after them.
She looked at Sebastian.
Sebastian stared at her.
Jhansi said, “I don't want you to fucking die, idiot.”
She looked back toward Binyelum.
Should she follow?
The Cursed Tardigrade lashed with its bladed tongue.
Light flickered.
Oh fuck.
The heads of both special ones went tumbling through the air, pushed upward by a fountain of red blood.
Oh what the fuck.
The tongue hooked through both wide-eyed skulls, skewering the head of Sir Whack-a-knight through the slit in their helm, lancing up through Dr. Chef’s throat and out their terrified mouth, carving through the fabric of their surgical mask.
Oh holy fuck no.
The Cursed Tardigrade pulled the meal back into its mouth.
No!
The dark shape said, {“Lucky fuck.”}
Jhansi screamed, {“What?!”}
The bodies of both special ones twitched on the floor, residual impulses putting up an embarrassing resistance against domination.
Jhansi felt like she might choke on her heart.
Fuck.
Her friends.
Shrill cries filled Jhansi’s head.
Her friends!
She would have to watch.
Their bodies twitching, jerking helplessly in the throes of death.
What the fuck could Jhansi possibly do?
Against a monster like that?
Wait.
Fuck.
No.
That didn't happen either!
Sir Whack-a-knight grabbed Dr. Chef's hand.
Their knight’s helm pulsed and dimmed.
The ground beneath Dr. Chef bowed downward, churning up a radial sine wave.
The shape held steady.
Then it rushed outward, swelling taller.
Sir Whack-a-knight bucked through the air and came down hard on their chin.
Scuba Scooper's body careened end over end.
The Cursed Tardigrade screamed, rolling awkwardly as the sine wave pushed it onto its back.
Oren reached forward.
He grabbed Velocity's wrist.
Velocity looked back.
Their astronaut helmet pulsed and dimmed.
Stars burst from Oren’s eyes.
They glittered across Velocity's body, and Nancy's, and Binyelum's, and the two of the trio still alive.
Splintering pinch harmonics filled the chamber.
All five special ones flickered from sight.
Five guitar cabs appeared in a midair semicircle above the overturned Cursed Tardigrade.
Noise exploded.
All five special ones rocketed down toward the alterling.
Binyelum threw an arm out behind them.
The skin around the Cursed Tardigrade's mouth pulled back.
Binyelum grabbed the first limb they found.
The Cursed Tardigrade's head shunted forward.
Binyelum’s eyes flashed.
A glittering grin split their face.
Sharp teeth traced a plummeting comet trail.
A soft tongue flicked forward to lick the curves of those canines.
Binyelum’s fox ear headband pulsed and dimmed.
They shouted.
“Die like a–”
Jhansi couldn't hear the last word over the concussion of sound.
She read it on Binyelum's lips.
“Star.”
Dr. Chef's free arm detonated.
Gold roiled in a churning surge outward from the mist of red blood and viscera.
The shape swelled.
A form coalesced.
Two pointed, swiveling ears.
Two delusionally manic eyes.
A long, long, long jagged line of brilliant razor teeth.
A massive, golden fox head leered down at the scene.
It shook itself.
Its eyes rolled across everyone assembled.
Its pupils flashed.
Its grin stretched all the way back.
Its mouth spread insanely wide, hinged in a full hemisphere.
The blade of a massive sword punched outward.
Singing.
Piercing to its full extension.
Resonating.
It bisected the Cursed Tardigrade.
It clove through the glass shelf.
It put into orbit a shimmering vortex of gore-splattered shrapnel.
The special ones crashed down to the first floor.
Both halves of the Cursed Tardigrade slammed down around them.
Silence roared.
Fuck!
The sound of fevered footfalls followed Jhansi across the glass.
She peered over the severed edge of the shelf.
Binyelum stood below.
They held Dr. Chef’s hand.
Monsters stared at them from every direction.
Their mask remained dimmed.
Fuck!
Their mask blinked back to vibrancy.
Oh fuck!
That quick?
They grabbed Nancy’s hand.
Oh fuck!
Let’s fucking go!
Everything in the room stared at Binyelum.
Jhansi’s heart pounded.
She panted hard.
The circumambient endlings backed away, almost in choreographed unison.
Fuck.
Baba Yagoo bobbed its head lightly, almost cutely, at the teenagers standing against it. Binyelum and Nancy took a step forward.
Binyelum called, “Sebastian!”
Sebastian blinked. He looked away from Baba Yagoo toward Binyelum and the others. Realization dawned.
The sound of Sebastian’s footsteps on the glass pulled Baba Yagoo’s attention. The monster shifted, craning the orb of its body. It followed Sebastian until he reached the escalator down to the first floor.
Then it looked at Jhansi.
Jhansi stared downward.
She could only just make out the pink surface of the monster’s flesh beneath the goo and between the plates of bone.
Raw and blistered.
Sebastian stepped off the escalator.
Baba Yagoo turned to face him again.
It paused. Then looked toward the far end of the food court. At what, Jhansi couldn’t tell.
The alterling stood for another short moment.
It bobbed again before backing away from the teenagers.
Its snout pounded and sucked at the pooled goo.
Jhansi watched it retreat.
It turned as it stepped into the cloak beyond the food court and did not look back.
Holy fuck.
Wait.
They had made it.
They had made it!
Fuck!
Oh fuck!
Oh what the fuck?!
They survived!
Fuck!
No way!
Binyelum let out a long sigh that turned into a laugh.
“Pejudo lo anmo.”
They let go of Nancy’s hand.
Jhansi blinked back a sob.
Holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck!
Binyelum looked up through the glass and waved.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!
Jhansi jogged toward the escalator.
Wait.
Her title.
She had to collect enough memory cards so she could new-game-plus another endling.
Something one of the good guys would do.
She looked around.
The corpse of a red endling.
From where?
Not important.
Jhansi launched herself onto the corpse.
Dr. Chef screamed.
Oh shit!
Their arm!
Jhansi looked up.
Sebastian’s flower crown remained dim.
Oh fuck.
He downed a memory card.
From where?
Didn’t matter.
Sebastian’s flower crown blinked back to vibrancy.
Whew, fuck.
Okay.
Jhansi plunged her arm into the corpse, retrieved the memory card, and stuffed it into her canvas bag.
She looked around.
A corpse lay near the escalator leading down to the first floor.
Binyelum called, “Jhansi!”
Jhansi ran toward the corpse, brought herself skidding to a halt, banged her knee on the glass, and plunged her hand inside.
Binyelum called, “Jhansi! Just get down here!”
Ugh!
Jhansi pulled free the memory card, stuffed it into her canvas bag, and pushed herself to her feet. Orange blood and stuff coated her arms, staining her clothes. A pool of it had accumulated in the bottom of the bag.
Gross.
Jhansi hurried down the escalator and ignored how wobbly her legs felt.
She reached the bottom and looked toward the others. Sebastian stood helping Dr. Chef to their feet. Binyelum, Oren, and Velocity stood watching. Nancy stood over Sir Whack-a-knight. They crouched against the massive shard of hewn glass and stared directly up at Nancy.
The bisected corpse of the Cursed Tardigrade lay split open in the background. Orange blood splattered the mountain of twisting organs and stuff that still gurgled out from the body. Visceral remnants of the green endling–mostly uniform fabric and fragments of bone–clung to the rows and rows of razor teeth twinkling in both halves of the monster’s cyclidrical head.
The fallen glass held aloft a ghostly mirror of the entire scene.
Weird energy.
Something twinkled.
Jhansi turned.
There!
Sir Whack-a-knight’s sledgehammer!
Returning a special one’s sword, also something a good guy would do.
Jhansi hurried over.
Binyelum called, “Jhansi goddammit!”
Jhansi didn’t look over her shoulder.
“Just hang on!”
The metal head glowed softly in the nebulite.
Jhansi hefted the weapon.
Heavier than she expected.
She hurried back toward the others.
Binyelum called, “Jhansi what the–”
The tone of their voice changed.
“–wait!”
Jhansi passed in front of Nancy.
Nancy’s eyebrows knit together.
Jhansi handed the sledgehammer to Sir Whack-a-knight.
She turned toward Binyelum.
What?
Dr. Chef held Sebastian by the hair.
They swung him around and yanked him against their chest.
Light shimmered on the blade pressed against Sebastian’s neck.
Why?
A bludgeoning impact bashed Jhansi’s legs out from under her.
She hit the glass hard.
The fire extinguisher bounced inside the canvas bag.
Fuck!
What the fuck?!
The dark void beneath the glass swelled with an eager call and filled Jhansi’s vision.
Jhansi pushed herself over.
Sir Whack-a-knight stood gripping their sledgehammer.
The head wavered above Jhansi.
Shit.
Shit!
Sir Whack-a-knight glared across at Nancy.
Nancy didn’t even blink.
She squeezed the handle of her ax.
Sir Whack-a-knight said, “Really think you’re faster than me?”
Nancy just stared.
Don’t push your luck, buddy.
Dr. Chef snarled at Binyelum.
“Give us that fucking memory card.”
Bineylum took a step forward.
A memory card glinted in their right hand.
They held it up, stared at it, and shook it vigorously. Droplets of orange blood splattered the glass. Binyelum stared at the card again, then turned. Their eyes passed over Jhansi, Sir Whack-a-knight, and Nancy.
Binyelum again looked at Jhansi.
What?
Fuck.
What did that expression even mean, anyway?
Binyelum sighed.
“This hasn’t taught you anything, has it?”
Oh fuck off.
The fist in Sebastian’s hair tightened and the knife pressed harder against his neck.
Dr. Chef repeated, “Give us that fucking memory card.”
Binyelum’s eyes shifted slightly.
Their expression hardened in a way Jhansi hadn’t yet seen.
Their face looked like a weapon.
And what a weird feeling to follow.
Bineylum said, “You’re really going to become a kineater? Over–”
They casually tossed the memory card into the air.
It flashed, flipping end over end.
Dr. Chef sucked in a breath.
Binyelum caught the card.
Dr. Chef exhaled.
Binyelum concluded, “–this?”
They narrowed their eyes.
“You’re after the memory.”
They looked toward Sir Whack-a-knight.
“Are you missing someone?”
Dr. Chef hissed, “You’re gonna be missing someone if you don’t hand over that fucking memory card.”
Bineylum sighed again.
“Just tell me what you’re looking for.”
They waved the card around.
“I’ll look for it in the memory.”
Dr. Chef shook their head.
Their voice trembled.
“Fuck you.”
Binyelum frowned.
“I’m trying to help you.”
Dr. Chef shook their head again.
“The fuck you are!”
The knife shuddered.
“Look at Terry, huh?”
They shouted it again.
“Look at Terry!”
Binyelum blinked.
They paused, then ignored the command.
“This person you’re looking for, were they missing pretty much from the moment the netherlume shift started tonight?”
Wow.
This side of Binyelum …
Where had this come from?
Dr. Chef shouted, “Fuck you! I’m gonna stab him!”
Sebastian said, “Binyelum.”
He sounded worried.
“He’s gonna stab me.”
He swallowed and squeezed his barbell.
Binyelum shrugged.
“Well, if you’re not looking for anyone–”
They waved the memory card.
“–I think I’ll keep this with me.”
Sebastian shouted, “Binyelum!”
Binyelum reeled back and whipped the memory card through the air with an overhand throw hard enough that it whistled.
Shit.
Dr. Chef made an indecipherable noise.
They reached for the memory card.
Sir Whack-a-knight’s sledgehammer began churning an arc that ended at Jhansi’s head
Fuck.
Nancy’s ax flashed.
The blade of Nancy’s ax caught the steel handle of the sledgehammer and wrenched the weapon from Sir Whack-a-knight’s grip.
It ricocheted end over end off the glass.
Double fuck!
Jhansi covered her face with her hands.
The sledgehammer battered the fire extinguisher and careened over Jhansi.
Dr. Chef snatched the memory card out of the air.
Sebastian bounced his fist off Dr. Chef’s teeth.
Oof.
A red stain swelled on Dr. Chef’s surgical mask.
Oren stepped forward and gently retrieved the memory card from Dr. Chef’s grip.
Dr. Chef slashed in a wild arc at both boys.
Sebastian blocked the blow with his barbell.
Binyelum stepped closer.
Dr. Chef grabbed the front of their face.
“Fucking–”
Their voice pitched upward.
“Pejudo!”
Jhansi’s heart pounded in her chest.
She panted.
She stared over her canvas bag at Sir Whack-a-knight.
Who had just tried to kill her.
Nancy stood pressing the blade of her ax firmly against Sir Whack-a-knight’s Adam’s apple.
The dark shape said, {“Pull them apart.”}
Jhansi said, {“I’m not a fucking bad guy.”}
The dark shape said, {“They almost fucking killed you.”}
Jhansi paused.
{“Besides.”}
She squeezed the handles of the canvas bag.
{“I can’t.”}
The dark shape laughed darkly.
Binyelum accepted the memory card from Oren.
They turned to Dr. Chef.
“Now are you going to tell me what you’re looking for in this memory card?”
Sebastian glowered at Binyelum.
“Are you fucking kidding?”
Dr. Chef balled their fists.
“Fucking–”
They paused.
“–people just don’t love anymore!”
Ooh.
It made sense now.
Dr. Chef glared at Binyelum.
“Terry’s dead because of you.”
They gestured across the entire chamber.
“What the fuck, man?”
They pounded their palm against their forehead.
“What the fuck was that?!”
They paused.
“Just fucking kill us already.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“I’m pretty sure we saved you.”
Dr. Chef spat, “Fuck you!”
Binyelum raised their eyebrows.
“You really think all three of you could have survived against both those alterlings?”
Dr. Chef growled.
Veins stood out on their neck.
Binyelum nodded.
“Right.”
They held up the memory card.
“Now, last chance. Tell me what you’re looking for.”
Sebastian scoffed.
“You’re really fucking serious.”
Binyelum gave him a look.
Sebastian made a face.
“Fucker tried to kill me!”
Binyelum nodded.
“And we stopped it. We hold all the power. The Asterlings don’t use power for punishment.”
Sebastian made a noise, but said nothing.
Bineylum looked at Dr. Chef.
Dr. Chef lifted up their surgical mask and spit blood onto the glass.
“Fuck.”
They rolled their eyes.
They glared at Binyelum.
“I can’t find my sister.”
Sebastian groaned.
Binyelum nodded.
“How will I recognize her?”
Dr. Chef sighed.
“Tall. Blonde. Athletic.”
Binyelum raised an eyebrow at Dr. Chef’s short stature, shock of black hair, and thin build.
Dr. Chef shook their head.
“Not by blood.”
Binyelum nodded.
Dr. Chef paused.
“Her name’s Eudora.”
Binyelum nodded again.
“Got it.”
They crushed the memory card.
Their body froze for the briefest moment.
They blinked.
“She’s not there.”
Dr. Chef lunged.
“Bullshit!”
They tripped over Oren’s lazy kick and sprawled on the glass.
“Fuck!”
Binyelum frowned.
“I’m not lying.”
They shook their head.
“Whatever took yours isn’t what took ours.”
Dr. Chef blinked.
“Yours?”
They shook their head.
They pounded the glass with a clenched fist.
“Fuck!”
Another strike.
“Fuck!”
They pushed themselves into a squatting position.
“You shit-sucking liar.”
They lifted up their surgical mask and spit out more blood.
“I’m gonna find my sister, and then I’m gonna fucking kill you.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“You really gotta pick somewhere else to project those feelings.”
Dr. Chef said, “Fuck you.”
Binyelum shrugged.
They squeezed the shards of the memory card and turned toward the corpse of the Cursed Tardigrade.
Dr. Chef blinked.
“The fuck are you doing?”
Binyelum didn’t reply.
They knelt and picked up a shard of glass from the floor.
Dr. Chef called, “Hey!”
They pushed themselves to their feet.
“Dumbass!”
Binyelum held the pointed fragment delicately between their index finger and thumb, then dropped it into their other hand. It clinked against the shattered memory card. Binyelum took two more steps and plunged their fist into the corpse of the Cursed Tardigrade. Bulbs of white stuff slopped down across their forearm.
Dr. Chef shouted, “What?!”
They laughed.
“What the fuck is wrong with you, man?”
Binyelum’s arm popped free of the corpse.
They turned back to Dr. Chef.
“I get asked that all the time.”
A reverberation echoed down from the north end of the mall.
Everyone paused, then turned in unison.
The sound swelled quickly.
A stampeding cadence.
Fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
What the fuck now?!
