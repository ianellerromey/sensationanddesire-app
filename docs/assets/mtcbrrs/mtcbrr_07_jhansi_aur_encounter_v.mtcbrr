Jhansi Aur - Start Encounter V

[MINUTES REMAINING is 1295]
[LUNAR TERMINATOR is 010.07%]

Dark waves susurrated in steady, adamant arrhythmia against the music.
Jhansi stood close enough to the water, with enough gathered light, that she could see the reflection of the moon.
Binyelum turned to address the Asterlings.
“Alright.”
They clapped their hands.
“It’s been a long night already, and it’s about to get way fucking longer.”
Velocity narrowed their eyes.
“Longer than my list of vices?”
Binyelum grimaced.
“Depends on how the next half hour goes.”
Oren said, “We’re gonna hang out here for a whole half hour?”
Binyelum nodded.
“Trust me. You’ll be glad.”
Oren’s eyes widened slowly.
“Pej.”
Binyelum continued.
“We’ll plan next steps when we meet back here. I need to clear my mind and think about this a bit. You all just focus on having fun.”
They grinned.
“No regrets. Unzip yourselves.”
Velocity grinned.
“Thanks Dad!”
They put on a mock pout.
“Can I have some money for the claw machine?”
Binyelum snorted.
“Only if I get to name your prize.”
Velocity squeed.
Sebastian said, “You say no regrets, but I’m guessing you don’t want us to get too fucked up.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yes. Thank you. Have chocolate milk with your cereal, not battery acid.”
Velocity said, “Chocolate milk with battery acid?”
Sebastian said, “No, with your frosted shit flakes.”
Nancy pulled her mouth into a flat line, popped the trunk, grabbed her ax, and stalked away.
Sebastian exhaled.
“Fuck.”
The Asterlings watched Nancy push through the crowd. Dancers balked and ducked aside as soon as they noticed her. She kept her gaze fixed pointedly on the dark beach beyond the party.
Her ax dragged trails through the sand.
Her passage didn’t go unnoticed.
Other teenagers turned to watch.
Nancy’s audience swelled and shifted around her until she passed through to the other side.
Sebastian whispered, “Fuck.”
Binyelum nodded.
“That’s our killer.”
Velocity clapped their hands.
“Neat trick, but I will not be passing through to the other side.”
They grinned.
The dark of their eyes sharpened at the center of their makeup vortex.
“I have business.”
Binyelum nodded again.
“That’s your prerogative.”
Ugh.
Binyelum nodded at Velocity, Sebastian, and Jhansi.
“Half an hour.”
They nodded again.
“Go on.”
They looked straight at Oren, then back at everyone else.
“I’ll catch up.”
Wait.
What?
Into the party?
Jhansi looked between Oren and Binyelum.
“Wha–”
Velocity put a hand on Jhansi’s shoulder.
“We’re going.”
What?
Jhansi blinked.
She looked between Velocity and Binyelum.
“Wha–”
Velocity squeezed Jhani’s shoulder.
“Come on.”
Binyelum nodded.
“We’ll catch up.”
Fuck.
Ugh.
Fuck.
Jhansi pulled away from Velocity.
“Fine.”
Sebastian snorted.
Velocity gave Jhansi a look.
Jhansi glared back.
“What?”
Velocity shrugged.
“Come on.”
They started toward the party.
Sebastian fell in beside them.
Jhansi lagged behind.
Ugh.
Velocity looked at Sebastian.
Their lips pulled back just a little.
“Purity junkie like you gonna make it in there?”
They nodded toward the crowd.
Sebastian mocked a laugh.
“Since when am I a man of the cloth?”
Velocity shook their head.
“I just mean, someone with your standards might end up awfully lonely in a place like this.”
Sebastian shook his head.
“Whatever. I’m just happy for a break.”
Velocity snorted.
The party loomed.
The wall of cars stretched from horizon to horizon.
Bodies crashed together in a blare of sound and light beyond gleaming sedan silhouettes.
Fuck.
No.
Nope.
Jhansi slowed.
Velocity and Sebastian didn’t notice.
Or didn’t care.
They continued past the vehicular sentinels and into the party.
Jhansi’s chest felt heavy.
Static pulsed throughout her interior space.
Binyelum’s slightly raised voice carried across the sand.
“What the fuck was that back there?”
What?
Jhansi turned.
Binyelum stood facing Oren, their right arm thrown wide in a dramatic gesture.
What the hell?
What did this mean?
Jhansi looked around.
She glanced at the party.
Ugh.
Jhansi crept in an arc back to Mambele and leaned against a wheel well.
Oren said, “What was what?”
Binyelum said, “Bridgemall.”
Oh.
Shit.
Right.
Oren paused.
He spoke in a muted tone that Jhansi hadn’t heard before.
“What about Bridgemall.”
Jhansi heard Binyelum gesture.
“When you fucked the plan.”
Oren shouted, “The plan was fucked anyway, Binyelum!”
Oh shit.
Had Jhansi ever heard Oren call Binyelum by their real name?
Binyelum said, “You didn’t listen to me.”
Oren snapped, “Am I not allowed to make my own choices?”
Wow.
Binyelum shouted, “Oren!”
They inhaled way too hard.
“You almost died!”
Oh.
Oren snapped, “We’re all gonna die, Binyelum.”
Holy fuck.
Binyelum growled, “What the fuck, Oren?”
Oren snapped, “What the fuck you, Binyelum.”
He paused.
“Why the fuck do you even care?”
Binyelum paused.
Their voice hummed.
“What?”
Oren paused.
For a long time.
Then spoke softly.
“I obviously don’t matter anymore.”
Binyelum paused.
“What?”
Another pause.
“Why would you feel that way?”
Jhansi heard Oren gesture.
“You’ve got a new favorite toy!”
Wait.
Did he mean Jhansi?
Should she peek?
Binyelum said, “She’s not a toy.”
Fuck!
What did that mean?
Bineylum paused.
“Is that how you think I see you?”
Oren groaned, “I don’t fucking know how you see me, Binyelum.”
He paused.
His tone hardened.
His words came through clenched teeth.
“You put me on fucking babysitting duty because I fucked up last night!”
Babysitting duty?
Wait.
What?
Last night?
Binyelum and Oren knew each other?
Right?
Oren let out a long sigh.
“You’re punishing me?”
Okay.
Wow.
Binyelum didn’t reply for a long time.
“I’m protecting you.”
What?
How does that fit in here?
Jhansi heard Oren gesture.
“You think I’m weak? Because I fucked up?”
Okay.
Oren made a mistake last night that he feels really bad about.
Binyelum …
Doesn’t think Oren made a mistake?
Bineylum said, “You didn’t fuck up.”
Bineylum definitely does not think Oren made a mistake.
Oren shouted, “What?!”
Jhansi heard Oren gesture.
“We died, Binyelum!”
Oh fuck.
Oh holy fuck.
Binyelum spoke almost plaintively.
“I’m sorry you feel this way about last night, but I’m not punishing you, and I’m not holding anything against you.”
Jhansi heard Oren gesture.
“People just don’t love anymore, Binyelum!”
Oh holy shit.
Oren shouted, “Let go of the fucking strings, Mister Marionette, and fucking talk to me!”
Binyelum paused.
They spoke quietly.
“I don’t puppet people.”
Oren snarled, “You and I both know that’s fucking bullshit.”
Binyelum didn’t reply.
Nobody spoke.
Music thudded into the silence.
Cheers rose above the crowd.
Bineylum’s voice softened.
Jhansi could barely catch it shimmering above the murmur of the bay.
“Bodyscythe, I’m the one who fucked up.”
Oh.
Oh!
Oh holy shit.
Shit!
Oh what the fuck does that mean?
Oren paused.
“What?”
Nobody spoke.
Binyelum sighed.
“I fucked up.”
Wow.
Fuck.
Oren said, “I was supposed to handle them, and I couldn’t.”
Oh.
Interesting.
Binyelum said, “The information was garbage.”
They paused.
“I thought I was sending you to feint endlings, not the fucking Final Hand.”
Oh.
Shit.
Oh shit!
The Final Hand killed Binyelum and Oren?
Oren said, “What?”
Binyelum paused.
They sighed.
“The information. It wasn’t just wrong. It was deliberately misleading.”
Interesting.
Oren paused, for a lot longer than Jhansi expected.
“What did Cherry do?”
Hang on.
What the fuck?
Jhansi had never heard that name before.
Who the fuck?
How did they fit into all of this?
Binyelum sighed again.
“I don’t know.”
They paused.
Their voice came slow and pained.
“I don’t think she did anything wrong.”
They paused again.
“I’m pretty sure it’s entirely my fault.”
Oren paused.
Again, for longer than Jhansi expected.
“What the hell does that mean?”
Hah.
Jhansi agreed.
Binyelum said, “I …”
They trailed off.
They sighed.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
Oren paused.
“Okay.”
Nobody spoke.
Huh.
Well.
What the hell?
Jhansi hadn’t actually learned anything.
Her legs began to cramp.
Oren said, “You gave me babysitting duty because you wanted to keep me off the frontline.”
He paused.
“Because you feel like my death is your fault.”
Wait.
Babysitting duty?
Hadn’t he said that earlier, too?
Did he mean Jhansi?
Wait.
What?!
Oren sighed.
“Fuck.”
He paused.
“Duet, I don’t want babysitting duty!”
What?
Static flickered around Jhansi’s interior space.
Binyelum said, “Oren, who else is going to do it?”
What?!
The static surged.
Jhansi didn’t need a babysit–
Well.
Okay.
Oren said, “Have Velocity do it.”
Binyelum said, “They can’t handle the responsibility.”
Oren said, “They handled Nancy’s arm.”
Binyelum snorted.
“And that makes them capable of managing Jhansi’s emotions?”
Ugh.
Jhansi the burden.
The static didn’t abate.
Oren groaned, “Well then what the fuck am I supposed to do?”
Binyelum’s voice softened.
“Just have fun.”
Tch.
He wouldn’t have much of a chance with Jhansi slung over his shoulders all night.
Oren paused.
“I think I need some time.”
Binyelum paused.
“Don’t spend the entire half hour on the beach.”
Oren paused again.
“Yeah. I know.”
He paused yet again.
“Thanks, Duet.”
Nobody spoke.
Then Jhansi heard the squeak and shuffle of shoes moving across sand.
Binyelum walked away toward the party with both hands stuffed into the pockets of their jeans.
The wavering lights threw a long shadow out behind them.
Oren stayed on the beach.
Hm.
What now?
Jhansi peeked under Mambele.
Oren stood rooted in place.
If Jhansi stood now, he would definitely see her.
Hm.
Fuck.
Oren turned.
He walked down the beach, toward the dark ribbon wet from the bay.
He sat just beyond the reach of the waves.
Hm.
Jhansi stood.
She walked over behind him.
“Hey.”
Oren jumped.
He whirled around, a menace etched into the lines of his face.
He saw Jhansi and paused.
Then blinked.
“Jhansi.”
He looked around.
Jhansi said, “I’m sorry for being such a pain.”
Oren blinked.
He blinked again.
He looked toward the party, then back at Jhansi.
“Did you overhear us?”
Fuck.
Jhansi couldn’t admit something like that.
She shook her head.
“What?”
Oren stared at Jhansi.
He shrugged and softened.
“Don’t worry about it.”
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“Don’t worry about being a pain in your ass?”
Oren chuckled.
“Yeah.”
He paused, then looked out toward the bay.
Jhansi waited for him to continue.
He didn’t.
Well.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked back toward the party, then down at Oren.
Maybe she should change the subject?
She lowered herself onto the cool sand.
“What’s your deal with the Final Hand?”
Oren blinked.
He gave Jhansi a look.
Jhansi said, “After we talked to those guys, you said you felt bad for them.”
Oren nodded.
“Ah.”
He stuffed his hands in the pockets of his jacket.
“You don’t think I should?”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“You sound like Binyelum.”
Oren laughed.
“I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or not.”
Jhansi laughed too.
She pulled her features into a vulpine leer.
“What do you think?”
Oren snorted.
“Uncanny.”
Jhansi grinned.
Oren stared at her.
A strange look passed across his features.
He shrugged.
“I feel bad for anyone used as a disposable pawn in someone else’s game.”
Huh?
Jhansi furrowed her brows.
“Pawn?”
She shook her head.
“Isn’t that the point of being a soldier?”
Oren quirked his mouth.
He stared at Jhansi.
“Maybe.”
He sighed.
And gestured, with his hands still stuffed into the pockets of his jacket, the garment billowing gently in the breeze.
“The Final Hand. The greatest fighting force in the netherlume shift, responsible for the most glorious victories ever witnessed beneath the looming moon.”
He made a face.
“Wouldn’t you want to join?”
What?
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“What are you doing?”
Oren shrugged.
“The Final Hand has an illustrious history. Most of the names we remember come from their ranks. General Flick Winsome. General Nate “Bad Eyes” Nath. General Viola Cassanova. General Akari. General Plinth. General Pierce.”
He raised both eyebrows.
“Notice a pattern?”
Jhansi mirrored Oren’s expression.
“Everyone’s first name is General?”
Oren nodded.
“Exactly.”
Jhansi shrugged.
“What’s your point?”
Oren nodded.
“Think about that alterling that chased us from Bridgemall.”
Jhansi nodded.
“The Island of Doctor Oh No.”
Oren smirked.
“Right.”
He paused.
“Do you think General Flick Winsome could have killed that thing by himself.”
Uh.
Jhansi frowned.
“Oren, I have no idea who that is.”
Oren shook his head.
“Doesn’t matter.”
He gestured.
“Just based on what you’ve seen tonight. Do you think that a special one working entirely alone could take down even a single monster?”
Oh.
Well.
Shit.
Jhansi flattened her mouth into a line.
“That sounds like a rhetorical question.”
Oren nodded.
“Exactly.”
Jhansi cocked her head.
“But somebody has to lead.”
Oren gestured erratically.
He opened his mouth, then closed it.
He pulled his left hand from his jacket and ran it through his hair.
“I know. I just–”
He sighed.
“There’s such a gulf of experience that separates anyone on the ground floor from those at the top.”
He paused.
“Down here you’re fighting white-knuckled for your life, watching monsters reduce your friends to pulpy omelets …”
He paused again.
“And up there, you’re calling the shots from the back seat of a 1986 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, surrounded by more memory cards than you can count.”
He gestured toward the water, then dug both hands into the sand.
“Every player is a whole person, with joy and fear and desire in their heart. I hate watching people voluntarily reduce themselves to a commodity to protect the comfort and ego and power of someone who values them only as a resource.”
He scowled.
“How fucking dehumanizing.”
Well.
Huh.
Jhansi blinked.
She laid back against the sand.
The dark sky spread wide above her.
“I thought they were just assholes.”
Oren laughed.
“That’s your prerogative.”
Jhansi scoffed.
“I don’t like being wrong.”
Oren laughed louder.
“Of course you don’t.”
The ambient sounds of the beach filled the space between Jhansi and Oren.
Jhansi pushed herself up on her elbows.
She traced Oren’s silhouette with her eyes.
A faint dusting of light from the party caught on the edges of his jacket and the softness of his hair.
Jhansi didn’t want to leave.
“How’s the hoarding work?”
Oren looked back at Jhansi.
Jhansi said, “The memory card thing. You said there’s some guy somewhere doing cartoon duck billionaire dives into a memory card stockpile in the back of his El Camino–”
She paused.
“–or whatever. But how’s that work? If everyone dies at the end of the night, how does anybody stockpile anything?”
Oren nodded.
“Ah.”
He shrugged.
“Moblings.”
Jhansi cocked her head.
“Moblings?”
Oren gestured.
“Sometimes, when an endling defects from its faction–or gets kicked out–instead of becoming a solitary predator or joining a small band of alterlings, it seeks out the camaraderie and familiar hierarchy of the moblings.”
Hang on.
Jhansi said, “Kicked out? I thought the endlings just executed everyone.”
Oren laughed.
“Executed everyone. I guess that’s not so far from the truth.”
Jhansi made a face.
“You know what I mean.”
Oren nodded.
“I do.”
He gestured.
“Only full moon endlings execute their weakest performers. Gibbous, quarter, and crescent endlings don’t execute, they exile.”
He gestured again.
“Theleon recruits exiles into the moblings. And …”
He paused.
“… Trust Fall recruits exiles into the underlings.”
Jhansi frowned.
“You’re losing me.”
Oren nodded.
“Right. Moblings.”
Oren gestured.
“They stockpile and protect resources on behalf of the various bands of special ones.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi waved her hands.
“Hang on.”
She shook her head.
“Endlings stockpiling resources on behalf of special ones?”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
Jhansi frowned.
“Why would an endling do anything on our behalf?”
Oren smiled.
“Our?”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“You know what I mean.”
Oren nodded.
“I do.”
He looked out toward the water.
“I don’t think there’s a straightforward answer.”
He looked up toward the moon.
“But I imagine there’s a lot of power in being the exclusive provider of a service that allows special ones to hoard wealth.”
That word again.
Jhansi said, “Power.”
Oren nodded.
“Yep.”
Jhansi looked out over the water.
A pinpoint of light flickered at the edge of the horizon.
Naval endlings?
Or some other piece of the world that Jhansi didn’t understand.
Jhansi heard Binyelum’s voice in her head.
Something something the value of information.
Jhansi exhaled.
“I’m guessing all that precious hoarded wealth doesn’t get evenly distributed among the ranks of the Final Hand.”
She paused.
“And anyone who gets access to it, they get to enjoy that access far from the gleam of gnashing endling teeth.”
Oren jabbed a pair of finger guns at Jhansi.
His hair fell across and shadowed his eyes.
Yep.
That seemed about right.
Jhansi nodded.
“How does one get to the top of that hierarchy?”
Oren chuckled.
“That right there, ladies and gentleman, is the sphinx’s most secret riddle.”
He gestured.
“Nobody really knows. Or at least, nobody that I know of.”
He paused.
“It’s something to do with the daydreaming, and something to do with the intersection of our real world and netherlume selves, and something to do with the events of the previous netherlume shift, and–”
He paused again.
“–You get it. Stuff that’s pretty far out of our control.”
Well that figured.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Then closed it.
She crossed her arms and looked up into the sky.
Oren said, “She begins to understand.”
He followed Jhansi’s gaze.
Silence began to grow between them.
Jhansi glanced toward the party.
Nope.
Jhansi looked at Oren.
“Captain didn’t seem like that.”
Oren blinked.
“What?”
Jhansi made a face.
“Captain.”
She gestured.
“The Final Hand captain guy.”
Oren laughed.
“Right, right, yeah. Captain didn’t seem like that at all.”
He paused.
He opened his mouth, then closed it.
Jhansi said, “Binyelum’s not like that.”
Fuck!
The words just came out! 
Oren frowned.
He paused.
Then shrugged and shook his head.
“No, Duet’s not like that.”
Whew.
Jhansi nodded.
“They care.”
Oren blinked.
His frown deepened.
He cocked his head.
“You really think so?”
Oh shit.
Fuck.
What the hell should Jhansi say?
She blinked.
“Uh.”
She paused.
“Yeah?”
She paused again.
“Obviously?”
Oren raised both eyebrows.
“Obviously?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
Of course.
Oren hadn’t grasped the importance of Jhansi’s role as the ultrarare specialing.
Or Binyelum’s determination to carry Jhansi forward to defeat Egaeus.
Oren didn’t understand Binyelum the way Jhansi did.
Well, fine.
Binyelum probably wanted it that way.
Everyone must come to their own understanding.
Or.
Something.
Binyelum liked that kind of shit.
Jhansi shook her head.
“Sorry. Maybe it’s just obvious to me? They just always put themselves right out front, y’know? They take the biggest risks to keep us safe.”
Oren stared at her for a long moment.
The stare persisted.
His mouth shifted.
“They do take risks, yeah.”
Okay.
Weird reply.
Jhansi nodded.
“And they’re always talking everyone through shit. They like, want us to grow.”
Oren kept staring.
“And that’s care?”
Jeez.
Jhansi frowned.
“Yeah.”
She paused.
“Obviously?”
She paused again.
“They pay a lot of attention to everyone.”
Oren didn’t stop staring.
He nodded slowly.
“Duet does care a lot about analyzing their teammates, and about cultivating in each of us the traits that are most useful to them.”
Jhansi’s frown deepened.
“Sounds different when you say it like that.”
Oren held Jhansi’s gaze, then broke his stare and shrugged.
“Maybe.”
He paused.
“I guess.”
He paused again.
“It depends.”
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Oren spoke first.
“Kinda one-sided when they’re so dishonest about their own feelings.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi blinked.
Binyelum’s manic, shining eyes flashed across her vision.
Imagined flickers of light winked off their titanic grin.
Dishonest?
The image of Binyelum stood from the driver’s seat, their bloodthirsty hands squeezing the steering wheel hard enough to crush a throat.
Binyelum hammered the annihilating force of their heart into every action they took in this world.
Who could call that dishonest?
Jhansi scowled.
“No.”
She shook her head.
“No way. Binyelum is honest about everything.”
Oren blinked at her.
He burst into full, boisterous laughter.
What?
Jhansi huffed.
“What’s so funny?”
Oren shook his head.
“It’s just–”
He calmed himself.
“–you would say that.”
He smiled.
“You two are exactly the fucking same.”
What?
How?
What?!
Heat rose hard in Jhansi’s cheeks.
Fuck.
What the fuck did that mean?
She couldn’t pretend the comparison didn’t feel good, but–
Jhansi pushed herself to her feet.
She glared down at Oren.
“I’m not dishonest.”
Ugh.
That definitely sounded like a pout.
Oren snorted.
A dark reflection of the bay danced in his eyes.
“I actually believe that you believe that.”
Ugh!
Fuck off.
Jhansi huffed, crossed her arms, and turned away from Oren.
The growl of aftermarket exhaust rumbled briefly above the thudding music.
A black 1990 Chevrolet Corvette rolled into view, its convertible top lowered.
A grinning special one with a mane of wild red hair spotted Jhansi.
They leaned far out of the car and waved.
What?
Red sat perched in the lap of another special one, a vaguely younger teenager with a green sidecut ponytail that framed the glittering halo of their eyebrow piercings.
Thick silver curls streamed in the wake of the driver.
They had one hand on the wheel, and the other buried between Green’s thighs.
A sick knot pulled at Jhansi’s stomach.
The Corvette slowed and pulled in alongside Mambele.
Red leapt over the passenger’s side door, their denim jacket billowing wide. Silver followed, handling the driver’s side door with deference, the long back of their monochrome flannel swirling. Green waited for Silver to open the passenger’s side door. Their lips parted to receive a heavy kiss before Silver tugged on their collar and pulled them to their feet.
The knot in Jhansi’s stomach hardened.
Ambient luminescence warmed three pairs of flushed cheeks and hungry eyes.
Fuck.
Green stretched. The tight fabric of their crop top lifted even further. Every soft contour of their stomach glowed angelic.
Red grabbed Green by the waist and pulled them into a decadent kiss, with wide open eyes and an uncompromising tongue. Green leaned in and eagerly pushed themselves up on their tiptoes. Red made a sound Jhansi couldn’t describe, then pulled back, mouth open, wet tongue glistening, smile resplendent. They turned and grabbed Silver’s squishy waist with their other hand, pulled them forward, reached up to grab a thick fistful of their hair, and rose to offer more barely controlled intimacy. Green watched, delirious. They bit their bottom lip and bounced on their heels.
Red pulled away from Silver.
Silver turned and tugged again on Green’s collar.
Green’s eyelids fluttered.
Their lips puckered reflexively.
Silver grinned.
They held Green at a rigid, aching distance.
Jhansi read the word on Silver’s lips.
“Beg.”
The dark shape said, {“Fuck.”}
Static pierced straight through the knot in Jhansi’s stomach.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jhansi turned back toward the water.
Oren watched her out of the corner of his eye.
He didn’t say anything.
Ugh.
Fuck.
Jhansi tried to dispel her blush.
Or the pain.
As if.
Fuck.
And of course she had a fucking audience.
Fuck.
Jhansi exhaled through her nose.
She crossed her arms.
She couldn’t keep a snarl from her tone.
“I guess we should get to the party, huh?”
Oren let out a long sigh.
He flopped backward onto the sand and let his arms fall wide.
“Should we?”
Wait.
Hang on.
Jhansi looked at Oren.
Oren stared up at her with an indescribable expression.
Jhansi said, “You don’t want to?”
That didn’t make any sense.
A boy like Oren would receive such a fucking welcome.
Oren shrugged.
Sand piled up against his shoulders.
He opened his mouth, sighed, closed it, then started again.
“I don’t fucking know what I want.”
Huh.
Unexpected.
Jhansi blinked.
What should she say?
No fucking clue.
Oren ran a sandy hand through his hair.
“I just–”
He paused.
“–fuck.”
He pushed himself to his feet, stomped after a receding wave, grabbed a rock off the beach, and hurled it out into the bay.
A faint splash echoed back.
Jhansi blinked again.
Oren sagged his shoulders.
He didn’t turn around.
“I’ve spent my whole life thinking I was perfect.”
Jhansi blinked yet again.
Oren gestured.
“Or, I guess, I thought I was supposed to be perfect.”
He paused.
“No.”
He shook his head.
“I thought I knew what I was supposed to be.”
He nodded.
Then sat down in the wet sand.
A fawning wave licked across his suede Nikes.
Ruined.
Oren stayed put.
Jhansi waited.
She really should say something.
She stepped forward.
“What did you think you were?”
Oren glanced at Jhansi.
He held his lips pressed tightly together.
They slowly spread into a wan smile.
“The hero.”
Wow.
Well.
Okay.
Jhansi blinked.
Oren laughed.
“Stupid, I know.”
He grabbed another rock and tossed it into the water.
“Everything just seemed to …”
He shrugged.
“… work out correctly.”
He nodded.
“Back in the real world. Here in the netherlume shift. I couldn’t lose. No matter what, I always got mine.”
He paused.
“And then last night–”
He paused again.
Jhansi waited.
Another wave lapped at Oren’s shoes.
He watched it impassively.
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Something flashed across Oren’s face.
He ground his teeth together and hammered a fist against the sand.
“Fuck!”
He looked up at the moon.
“Fuck!”
His eyes went unfocused.
He seemed to lose awareness of Jhansi altogether.
“I was just another fucking pawn? The entire fucking time? Was I good at fucking anything? Ever?”
He shook his head violently.
“What about in the real world? Am I good at anything there? Or am I just following another goddamn script?”
He chuckled darkly.
“Oren’s special ability, a lucky fucking break. Thank God for socially conditioned hierarchical pattern matching, right?”
He leaned forward and forced his fingers into the sand.
“Fuck!”
He pushed his fingers in deeper.
“How weak am I?”
He shook his head softly.
“Was I just delusional?”
He squeezed the sand in his fists.
“Fuck!”
He closed his eyes.
“Who the fuck am I?”
He tensed his entire body.
“Am I just another goddamn fucking jerger?”
Holy shit.
Oren punched this sand with both fists.
“I don’t want to give my life away for someone else’s dream.”
Wow.
Jhansi blinked.
Um.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Oren really trusted her with this?
Well.
Maybe not.
But either way.
Holy fuck.
This meant something.
She couldn’t fuck this up.
But.
What could she say?
What did Oren need?
He seemed like he just needed to feel okay.
And why shouldn’t he get to feel okay?
That hero stuff …
That responsibility fell to Jhansi.
Could she say as much?
Well.
Oren had accused her of emotional dishonesty.
Might as well prove him wrong.
Jhansi stepped in front of her friend.
Freezing water washed over her shoes.
She smiled.
“Hey.”
Oren looked up.
Jhansi nodded.
“Y’know, it’s okay if you’re not the hero.”
Oren huffed and rolled his eyes.
Fuck.
Jhansi held up her hands.
“No no no, I didn’t mean it like that.”
She knelt.
Her skirt splayed across the sand.
“I mean–”
Fuck.
What did she mean?
Jhansi poked a hole in the sand.
Water swelled into the hollow.
“You don’t have to die for someone else’s dream.”
She gestured.
“You got another lucky break.”
Oren frowned.
Jhansi grinned.
“Luck isn’t such a bad skill to have.”
She looked toward the party.
“You’re here, alive, free to do whatever you want with your night. You’re not stuck at the bottom of someone else’s power hierarchy. You’re one of the Asterlings. You’re Oren.”
Oren’s frown deepened.
“None of what I’ve ever done in all my life actually matters.”
He shook his head.
“None of it speaks to who I feel like I am–”
He pressed a palm against his chest.
“–in here.”
Jhansi glanced at Oren, then back at the party.
And sighed.
“You’ve got a chance to figure it out.”
She shook her head.
“Don’t worry about the heroics. That’s someone else’s responsibility. Maybe–”
She turned away from the party.
“–Maybe the whole point is just to have fun.”
That sick knot tightened in Jhansi’s stomach.
Oren stared.
Then snorted.
“Someone else’s responsibility?”
He pushed himself to his feet.
“Don’t fucking tell me–”
Jhansi interrupted.
“Why the fuck else am I here, Oren?”
She gestured across the horizon.
“What the fuck am I doing here, if I’m not special?”
Oren burst into laughter.
He grabbed his sides and doubled over.
Ugh.
Well.
Fine.
Jhansi’s mouth fell into a flat line.
Oren’s laughter subsided.
He shook his head and smiled.
“You sound just like me.”
His eyes roved across Jhansi’s face. They paused intermittently, for varying durations, occasionally bouncing between the same two points before moving on. Jhansi felt her expression soften.
Oren said, “You really believe that, don’t you?”
Jhansi’s eyes flickered.
“I know it.”
Oren grinned.
He chuckled.
Jhansi added, “Binyelum does too.”
Oren blinked.
He raised both eyebrows.
He stared at Jhansi, then looked toward the party.
More laugther.
Then a hand through his hair.
“People just don’t love anymore.”
He shook his head.
“I can’t believe this.”
He let his shoulders sag.
A strange smile drew itself across his features.
He opened his mouth, then closed it.
He looked at Jhansi.
“You’re really something else.”
Um.
Okay?
Jhansi made a face.
“Thanks?”
Oren chuckled.
Then shrugged.
“I think I might even kinda believe in you.”
He looked up toward the moon.
“For some stupid reason.”
He paused.
“Fuck.”
He shook his head.
“Guess I’ll leave that responsibility to you, then.”
He gestured toward the party.
“I’m going to go enjoy myself.”
A brilliant grin bloomed before Jhansi’s eyes.
“You're a good friend.”
Wow.
Fuck.
What?
Jhansi blushed.
“Thanks.”
Jhansi and Oren turned together toward the party.
Oren smirked.
“Coming with?”
Well.
She couldn’t turn back now.
Jhansi nodded.
“Of course.”
Oren stepped first. Jhansi followed. The bay receded behind them, rolling water smearing away any trace of the symbols they had carved in the sand.
Oren stood straight.
Long rays of ambient color streamed off his silhouette.
Had Jhansi ever seen Oren hold his body like that?
Fuck.
Jhansi had done it.
Oren had called her a good friend.
He had said that he believed in her.
Holy fuck.
It felt like this whole world belonged to Jhansi.
It felt like she could do anything.
It felt like she had a purpose.
If she wanted to, she could dance with Binyelum.
Music slammed harder against Jhansi’s chest with every step.
The flickering lights towered against the sky.
Partying teenagers swayed and bounced against each other.
The silver curve of the moon glinted off every car.
Oren and Jhansi stepped between a deep blue and a bright red sedan.
Someone stood leaning against the red sedan on the right, a 1992 Ford Escort LX.
A figure clad entirely in orange, wearing a long cloak and a bent conical hat with a strangely wide and shadowed brim.
Okay.
The grip of a kendo stick–what, a shinai? yeah–stuck out from beneath the cloak.
Nothing moved beneath the hat as Jhansi passed.
But a pair of small ears fluttered in the shadows beside the figure.
Alright then.
Jhansi crossed through into the press of bodies.
Oh.
No.
Oh no.
An electric, sensual joy filled the empty space between every dancing teenager.
The thrill of shared decadence.
The knowledge that nobody would hold back.
Everyone here put everything they had into amplifying the ecstasy.
It glinted off jewelry, and eyes, and slick beads of sweat.
Fuck.
The satellite of Jhansi’s self-perception crashed down into her with annihilating alien fear.
Fuck.
Jhansi couldn’t see herself at all.
Fuck.
What the fuck did she think she could do here?
How could she possibly prove she deserved presence in a space like this?
She didn’t understand any of the rules.
She didn’t understand any of the language.
She didn’t understand how to move her body without looking like a fucking retard.
Ultrarare specialing?
That didn’t mean shit if she couldn’t demonstrate her value.
What kind of treatment would an outsider receive?
The knot in Jhansi’s stomach gnashed and pulled and squeezed.
Static hummed to life throughout Jhansi’s interior space.
Fuck.
She had to leave.
She turned to Oren.
Someone grabbed Oren’s hand.
A black-haired teenager wearing a cropped white tanktop and a snug pair of ripped denim shorts.
They beamed at Oren, then shouted something over the music that Jhansi couldn’t decipher.
Oren returned the smile, shy at first, before it spread into a grin that lit up his face.
He allowed the crowd to swallow him up.
His back disappeared through a wall of bodies.
Fuck.
Static lashed against Jhansi.
Fuck!
Jhansi whirled around.
The crowd had pulled her deeper too.
Bodies drummed against her own.
Shit.
Shit shit shit.
Should she find Binyelum?
They’d probably just make fun of her.
Another stab of searing static.
Fuck!
She had to get out of here.
Wait it out by Mambele.
Or.
Something.
Anything, really.
Anything but this.
Jhansi pushed through a tight group of teenagers.
A bright voice called out, “Hey!”
Not a voice Jhansi recognized.
She ignored it.
The voice said, “Hey! Wetskirt!”
What?!
Heat rose hard in Jhansi’s cheeks.
What.
The.
Fuck.
Jhansi whirled, her expression completely out of her control.
Before her stood one of the most beautiful people she had ever seen in the flesh.
What?
Shit.
Fuck!
Jhansi’s entire body tensed.
Shit.
The music sped up, the beat hitting faster and harder, distortion blending the kick and the snare into a roiling thunder that washed away the lead and droning pads.
The short eighteen-year-old wore a baby pink long-sleeve fishnet top and a pair of black dolphin shorts with pink stripes down the sides. The thin straps of a black g-string arced up over their hips to gently squeeze the softness of their waist. Small metal rings fixed with glittering pink stones dangled from both their nipples. A black and pink fishnet choker hugged their neck. Shockingly white lipstick traced the wide curve of their mouth.
They smiled, and their wet, pink tongue stuck out just slightly from between their teeth.
Haha.
What?
What the fuck?
No.
No way.
This?
This?!
Seriously?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jhansi’s body hurt.
It seethed, really.
Fuck.
The dark shape and Jhansi stared at each other.
What the fuck should Jhansi do?
What.
The fuck.
Should she do?
The Doll said, “You had an accident.”
She pointed to Jhansi’s skirt.
“Are you okay?”
Oh.
Right.
Wait.
What?
Oh.
No.
No no no.
Absolutely not.
What?!
What the fuck?!
Someone like this?
Calling Jhansi out for pissing herself?
What the fuck?
What the fuck!
Jhansi.
Seriously?
What a fucking loser.
Static bombarded Jhansi’s interior space.
Her body immolated.
A high-pitched keening rang in her ears.
The music kept speeding up.
Dancers around Jhansi swayed in hungry syncopation.
Someone to Jhansi’s left grabbed a nearby wrist. Their checkered bandana pulsed and dimmed. Electricity flickered along every hair on the receiver’s body and collected in pinpoint pearls at the end of every strand. Bandana hurled Battery’s wrist downward. Each shimmering pearl of light ignited into a bolt, live and in motion. The barrage pummeled the beach. Each impact blasted sand into glass.
Wait.
What?
Fuck.
Jhansi couldn’t think.
She shook her head.
“What?”
The Doll giggled.
“You need new pants.”
They gestured.
“You haven’t refreshed at your car, so like, something’s up.”
They leaned forward.
Fuck.
Jhansi had absolutely no idea where to look.
The Doll smiled.
“I just wanna make sure you’re okay.”
Shit.
Fuck.
Shit.
Jhansi had to say something.
Something.
Come on.
Anything.
Let’s go.
Jhansi shouted over the music.
“I have to find my friends!”
Fuck.
Fuck!
The Doll pursed their lips.
“So you’re not going back to your car?”
What?
No.
Of course not.
Jhansi shook her head.
“No.”
The Doll shrugged.
“‘Kay.”
They peeled off their shorts.
Their thighs jiggled lightly as they stepped free.
They smiled and held the small piece of clothing out for Jhansi.
“Don’t wanna walk around with piss all over yourself.”
What?
What?
What?
Jhansi blinked.
The Doll shook the shorts.
“C’mon.”
They gestured.
“I’ll help you find your friends.”
The music stopped.
Jhansi blinked again.
She looked at the shorts.
She looked at The Doll’s body.
A voice boomed out over the crowd.
“Alright okay hell yeah fuck yeah! Give it up for DJ Deadbell! Make some fucking noise make make some fucking noise make some goddamned motherfucking noise!”
The crowd shouted and cheered, clapped their hands and stomped their feet, filled the air with bursts of celebratory gift sharing.
The Doll turned toward the voice. She clenched her fists, bounced in place, squeezed shut her eyes, and shouted into the riot.
Jhansi couldn't stop herself from watching every subtle sway of The Doll’s body.
Everything hurt so fucking bad.
The voice cut through the noise.
“No breaks tonight, kiddos. Stay in motion. Stay in motion! Stay in fucking motion!”
A new duo replaced DJ Deadbell on the dais.
The voice continued.
“Hero’s A Cheerleader takes the stage to carry on the tradition. Let's see some motherfucking school spirit!”
The crowd bayed with excitement.
At the center of the dais a tall teenager with bushy brown curls, wearing a black maxi dress ripped off below their thighs, with feet and hands and lips covered in red paint or blood, grabbed the wrist of their partner, a shorter teenager wearing a yellow romper patterned with pink and green dismembered body parts.
Heavy kicks thudded through the crowd.
The taller teenager inhaled, pulled their partner’s wrist toward their mouth, and screamed.
VOLTRON WITH A BAT, PIRANHA AND A DINGO
HIT YOU IN THE HEART, MAKE YOUR LITTLE THING GO
The Doll beamed at Jhansi.
“I fucking love these guys.”
OOF, BABE, GIVE IT TO ME NOW
HOW’S IT FEEL WHEN IT GROWS?
The Doll pressed their shorts into Jhansi's hands.
“C’mon!”
LIKE, CAN YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE?
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE GOD?
Jhansi stared at the garment in her fist.
Wait.
MOMMY, KISS IT ALL BETTER!
IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
They really meant it.
They really meant it?
Fuck!
Did they expect Jhansi to just pull off her skirt right here?
Who the fuck wanted that?
No way.
Not a chance.
They couldn't possibly mean it.
IT’S YOUR WHOLE WORLD ON A PLATTER
YEAH, GOTTA CLIMB THE LADDER
Then what?
A trick?
Some kind of game?
To get Jhansi to act like an idiot?
GOTTA SHOW ‘EM EVER AFTER
IS YOURS
Static impaled Jhansi from every direction.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Nothing else made sense.
Jhansi’s hands shook.
She had to get out of here.
She backed away from the Doll.
“I, uh–”
OH MY GOD BABE
Jhansi shook her head.
No excuses came.
“I, uh–”
I AM SO
Come on.
Say something.
FUCKING
“I, uh, I can’t.”
BORED
The Doll blinked.
“You sure you’re okay?”
A dissonant melody driven by grimey synths shuddered down on top of the drums.
Jhansi shook her head again.
Her knuckles went white around the Doll’s shorts.
Barbed arms of static beat the absolute living shit out of her.
Holy fuck everything hurt.
Points of pain brightened behind Jhansi’s eyes.
No.
No.
No.
Jhansi forced her gaze downward.
“I gotta go.”
She pushed past the Doll.
Do.
Not.
Cry.
Do not fucking cry.
Static fucking wailed.
Jhansi could hardly feel it.
The Doll spoke as Jhansi passed.
“Alright …”
Jhansi didn’t look back.
She had to get away.
A teenager fell against her and almost knocked her over.
She lashed out, shoving them back with all her might.
Do.
Not.
Fucking.
Cry.
Jhansi passed by two teenagers in the middle of sharing a gift. A bright pile of multicolored sand, purple and yellow and green and red, collected in the receiver’s outstretched palm. A seedling sprouted from the top of the pile. It grew and stretched with uncanny speed toward the moon. The teenager leaned in toward their hand and bit off the head of the plant. Bright clouds of color swirled through the whites of their eyes. They swaggered backward.
Degenerates.
Fuck.
Why the hell had Binyelum brought them here?
A pillar of static smashed straight into Jhansi’s face.
She pushed forward.
Headlight radiance washed over her body, throwing her struggle into more luminous relief with every step she took.
Everyone could see how pathetic she looked.
The darkness beyond the cars churned.
Just out of reach.
Just a little further.
No one would find her out there.
Velocity stood between two cars, their back to Jhansi, their body pressed against another teenager. 
Fuck.
A thick white bow tied back the other teenager’s shoulder-length blonde hair. Black cat-eye glasses outlined their soft, mousy features. Velocity’s left hand lifted their cropped and frilled white tank top, exposing their small breasts. Velocity’s right hand lifted their high-waisted skirt, striped with intermittent black and desaturated rainbow colors, to their pink panties.
Fuck!
Cat Eyes raised their right leg and pressed the thick sole of a white high top Converse sneaker against the car behind them.
They panted, mouth half open, gazing down into Velocity’s eyes. 
Shit shit shit.
Jhansi did not need to fucking see that.
Or for Velocity to fucking see her.
Jhansi swerved.
Velocity pulled their hand out from under Cat Eyes’ tank top and tugged firmly on their hair.
“Kneel.”
How would Velocity’s eye makeup look from below?
A thick arm of static swung hard into Jhansi’s gut.
Motherfucker!
Jhansi stumbled.
Darkness swallowed her up.
Oh.
Jhansi looked around.
A wall of light and noise blared behind her.
Fuck!
She had made it.
Velocity directed Cat Eyes to their knees.
Nope.
Jhansi turned away.
She let out a rattling sigh.
Her body throbbed.
What a fucking joke.
Jhansi bent double.
Good job.
Idiot.
What the fuck comes next, huh?
Jhansi glanced back at the party.
Nope.
Not a fucking chance.
Jhansi let her feet carry her further down the beach.
Away from the bodies.
The fucking bodies.
What the hell.
Why did everyone have to fucking act like that?
Did they really not understand the fucking stakes at all?
Of course not.
They never did.
No one ever understood.
Jhansi had spent her whole life watching idiots just like these prioritize lifestyles that fundamentally excluded her.
Nobody else gave a shit.
They just wanted to get theirs.
Well.
Fuck them.
Fuck them all straight to hell.
While they wasted their evening goofing off and making out and fucking taunting Jhansi, she would save the entire fucking world.
Then they’d understand.
How it felt.
Even Binyelum.
Jhansi made a face.
What a dumbass move, bringing the Asterlings here.
Ugh.
Like.
Ohhh, look at me, Binyelum the Best, so fucking cool and fucking competent and fucking above it all.
I know everything and I can do whatever I want.
Fucker.
Now that Jhansi thought about it, Oren had probably spoken the truth.
Of course an asshole like Binyelum would hide their feelings.
Maybe they didn’t even have any.
The cloak swelled between Jhansi and the party.
A large shape loomed to Jhansi’s left.
Spiraling tendrils branched out from a smooth, crouching body.
Wait.
What?
Jhansi froze.
Her mind went completely blank.
Her heart pounded in her throat.
Fuck.
Had it seen her?
Would she die right here?
In this pathetic fucking moment?
Could she run?
Had she already hesitated too long?
Jhansi’s blood ran ice cold.
And.
The thing didn’t move.
Jhansi waited.
And waited.
The thing still didn’t move.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
She took a hesitant step.
The thing still didn’t move.
What the fuck?
Jhansi took another step.
The thing came into focus.
The trunk of a tree, stripped of all its bark by the ocean and deposited here on the beach.
Jhansi laughed out loud.
Of course.
Of fucking course.
How fucking stupid.
Well.
Whatever.
Maybe something would get her out here.
Maybe some giant fuckoff monster would find her alone and helpless, with nobody around to save her, nobody to even hear her shrieks of terror and pain as the monster pulled off her limbs one by one, impaling her through the chest with her own splintered bones, tearing open her abdomen, popping her organs like overripe tomatoes, ripping out her spine–
Maybe nobody would ever bother to come looking for her.
Maybe they would.
Tch.
Right.
They’d find her and laugh.
Well.
Fuck them.
They’d all die anyway.
Good.
Fucking good.
Fucking.
Fuck!
Fuck Binyelum.
Toying with everyone from their seat of superiority.
Maybe they’d even sent that awful bitch to find Jhansi.
Just for the sake of watching her squirm.
Jhansi realized she still held The Doll’s shorts.
Fuck!
Stupid goddamned motherfucking fuck!
Jhansi ground her teeth together. 
She looked at the dark fabric.
Then at her own stained skirt.
Then rolled her eyes up to the dark sky.
“Fuck!”
Well.
Fine.
Whatever.
Jhansi teetered as she stripped off her skirt. The waistband caught against her left flat and slipped it off. Jhansi growled, gripped the skirt with both hands, and pulled on it as hard as she could.
She didn’t have the strength to tear it.
Oh.
Come.
On.
Jhansi threw the garment onto the beach. She stomped on it with her heel and ground it into the sand. She leaned over and screamed at it. She grabbed it in her fist, dragged it over to the water, and clumsily threw it in.
The water receded.
The skirt remained on the beach.
Fuck!
Jhansi kicked the skirt further into the water.
It slid across an incoming wave and drifted further into the bay.
Fucking good.
What a pathetic embarrassment.
Just like Jhansi.
Water soaked into the garment.
It fluttered and fell.
A slowly dancing phantom.
Disappearing beneath the waves.
An ache welled in Jhansi’s chest.
What had the fucking skirt done to her, anyway?
It hadn’t pissed on itself.
She had thrown it away, forever, after losing her temper like a child.
How did the skirt feel about that?
Jhansi’s teeth ground together.
What the fuck kind of thoughts are those?!
What kind of fucking damage did she have?!
Fuck!
Jhansi shouted, “Fuck!”
Why did everything always have to feel like this?
Why did everything always have to fucking hurt?
Everything!
Always!
Why did she have to fucking hurt everything?!
She looked down at the shorts she still held.
Fucking.
Stupid.
She pulled back her arm.
She saw herself throwing the shorts into the water.
What the fuck would she do after that?
Hike her ass back to the party in her fucking panties?
Dumbass bitch.
Jhansi groaned.
Her arm went limp.
She looked down at the shorts yet again.
Stupid things probably wouldn’t even fit.
She stared out at the water.
Fine.
Fuck it.
Jhansi stepped into the shorts and pulled them up.
They hugged her waist and stretched comfortably around her thighs.
Of fucking course.
Somehow that felt like the worst humiliation yet.
Jhansi stared down at herself.
How did she look?
Fucking insane, probably.
Well.
Whatever.
She looked back toward the party.
The lights barely pierced through the cloak.
Nobody could possibly know where she had gone.
Jhansi found herself alone.
For the first time that night.
Not a single other person to perceive her.
Fucking.
Finally.
The moon winked overhead.
What a nightmare.
Jhansi exhaled.
Long.
And slow.
Fuck.
Holy.
Fuck.
What …
How could anyone expect her to deal with any of this?
What a fucking nightmare!
Fuck!
Jhansi exhaled again.
Fuck.
She stretched.
Her back popped in three places.
Tears welled without warning in her eyes.
Nope.
Don’t think about that stuff.
Anything else.
She looked good in a piece of clothing.
For like, the first time ever.
That had to count for something.
And hey.
She’d already stepped out into new territory.
And nobody could see her.
She could keep going.
Just a little.
Jhansi stepped awkwardly to the right, then quickly shuffled her left leg and snapped her heels together.
This felt so fucking stupid.
Jhansi groaned.
She threw back her head.
She shook herself.
No.
She could do this.
Jhansi stepped back to the left.
And this time gyrated her torso.
A little.
Her arms stayed adamantly fixed at her sides.
Fuck.
Fucking bullshit.
Jhansi lifted her hands.
Her elbows remained locked against her waist.
She stepped to the right again and dipped with the movement.
Okay.
Yeah.
That could work.
Jhansi stepped back to the left.
Then to the right.
She relaxed.
Her hands could wave as they pleased.
Her feet wanted to carry her in a slow circle.
Jhansi closed her eyes.
Her hands moved up toward her neck.
Her heart pounded in her chest.
It felt.
Really fucking good.
Jhansi dragged her feet and drew trails in the sand.
She bobbed her head.
She smiled.
She opened her eyes.
A figure sat atop the driftwood obelisk, their feet dangling into space.
Something about their silhouette seemed wrong.
A suggestion of missing anatomy.
The long handle of a fireman’s ax protruded from the dead wood beside them.
Nancy sat watching Jhansi dance alone beneath the moonlight.
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi froze.
A new wave of wildfire voltage screamed to life.
Tears welled instantly.
Absolutely.
Fucking.
Not.
No way.
No.
No no no.
Not a fucking chance.
Fuck!
Jhansi turned.
She sprinted down the beach.
She slipped.
And went down.
Her teeth clacked together.
Fuck!
Jhansi ground them even harder against each other.
Stupid.
Fucking.
Bitch!
Static blasted her body.
Jhansi lurched back up into a run.
The beach stretched onward.
The dark sky pinwheeled above.
The sand sucked at Jhansi’s clumsy feet.
Maybe for a thousand years.
But probably only for thirty seconds.
Some edifice narrowed the beach.
A culvert.
Jhansi slowed.
Her breath came in quick pants.
She looked back.
She couldn’t see anything through the cloak.
Fuck.
Someone had actually seen her dancing.
Fuck!
A jagged spear of static stabbed through Jhansi’s stomach.
She pressed a palm to the cold concrete and doubled over.
A hiss pushed through her clenched teeth.
Fuck.
Jhansi exhaled.
Then took a shuddering breath.
She righted herself.
And looked around.
The cloak hung heavy in every direction.
Truly alone.
And.
Vulnerable.
Her evisceration daydream reappeared unbidden.
It carried a different weight this time.
Jhansi swallowed.
She really should head back.
Well.
What would Binyelum say?
Ugh.
More esoteric bullshit.
Something about the story told through her actions.
Something to make her doubt the structure of the narrative.
As if.
Jhansi understood the narrative perfectly.
A stupid, useless girl fucks up every last little thing and then fucking dies about it.
Fuck.
Jhansi looked toward the water.
Something caught her eye.
A trail of delicate pawprints snaked through the sand.
They trailed down into the culvert ditch, disappeared briefly beneath the lazy stream that trickled there, and continued further out into the night.
What the hell?
Jhansi knelt.
The prints looked too big for a rodent.
Then, a cat?
Weird.
Jhansi hadn’t seen a single animal in the netherlume shift.
Then, a monster?
Maybe.
Jhansi couldn’t imagine why an alterling would choose to take the shape of a cat.
Besides.
She really should turn back.
Except.
More running away?
Really?
Fuck.
No.
Jhansi pushed herself up and followed the pawprints.
The sand wetted by the culvert sucked at her flats.
Cold water soaked through.
Graffitied tags watched her pass.
Vvlol.
Uru.
Poast.
The pawprints tracked away from the beach and up into the trees clustered along the shoreline.
Jhansi’s feet reflexively redirected her.
Taking her further away from a reality where anyone would find her.
Well.
What did she care?
Fuck a coward.
The tracks meandered slightly, but never far, as though driven by purpose. Jhansi followed them up over a short incline, then through difficult foliage on a path parallel to the beach. Twiggy shrubs clawed at her legs.
It sucked.
Jhansi lost sight of the tracks.
She knelt and swept aside sharp swaths of grass.
She smacked the back of her hand on a hidden rock.
Fuck!
Forget it.
Jhansi turned back.
Then she heard it.
Something snapped.
Oh.
Fuck.
Jhansi froze.
Her blood ran cold.
Her entire body tensed.
She looked over her right shoulder.
Then her left.
Where had the sound come from?
Jhansi stared into the empty cloak.
Her senses found a rhythm.
Hm.
Jhansi swallowed.
She shook her head.
Ignore it.
Turn back.
Head back to the Asterlings and–
And fucking what, exactly?
Jhansi held her breath.
She searched within the sound.
And found at least three sources.
The rhythm came from an insistent sucking, the squelches varied in intensity but unrelenting.
A rush of heavy breathing carried through the interstices.
Something like a chitter, or maybe a whimper, cut through at intervals.
An alterling fight?
It didn’t sound like a fight.
Every instinct in Jhansi’s body screamed at her to flee.
And give the Asterlings one more fucking thing to make fun of her about?
Yeah right.
Jhansi followed the sound.
She passed into a copse of black birch trees.
Dark pylons rose around her.
She remembered the weight of the grain elevator.
And.
Then.
Something caught her eye.
Orange blood.
An erratic line of it.
Smeared along the ground.
Across trampled foliage.
Leading to a discarded limb.
A human limb.
Fuck.
Jhansi blinked.
Wait.
No.
She saw waxy, translucent skin, with alien muscle topography beneath, and looping digits that curled without joints.
Decidedly inhuman.
More orange blood led deeper into the trees.
Jhansi crouched.
She tried to move quietly.
But it didn’t really matter.
She didn’t have to go much further.
The scene exploded across her awareness and exterminated her every thought.
Jhansi’s eyes bulged.
She fell back a pace.
She almost said, “Fuck,” out loud.
A bipedal insectoid alterling squatted in the middle of a small clearing. Four armored legs worked furiously to piston the monster’s hips forward and back. Each thrust hit with brutal force.
The alterling leaned over something. It supported itself with one strained forelimb. Splayed talons churned up dark earth.
Its other forelimb held another alterling pinned supine by the neck against the ground.
Wait.
The domineering alterling’s scraggy carapace blurred into the shadows. Patches of stiff hair mottled the topology. A jagged spray of antennae jutted at angles from the top of the monster’s rhombic head, and from the center a pair of hooked pincers menaced, with extra pairs flanking on either side. An oily fluid dripped from all three feeding orifices.
The center pair of pincers held the bloated bulb of the bottom alterling’s head in a messy vice grip.
The pincers squeezed hard anytime the victimized monster uttered a cry.
The bottom alterling writhed, its translucent skin distended around swollen pink musculature. It lashed out continually. Numerous tentacle forelimbs beat against the looming carapace. Suckers latched onto the thick shell and accomplished nothing.
A humanoid torso stretched down from beneath the alterling’s umbrella of tentacles. Soft rib cage curves gave way to a hooked, urgently gnashing beak protruding from the creature’s navel. Delicate pelvic trajectories opened up onto two slender, disproportionately long legs kicking wildly out into the air on either side of the converging bodies.
What the fuck.
What the fuck?!
Jhansi discovered the source of the sucking noise.
Her stomach flipped.
A mass of sinewy tubes strained outward from Cephalopatra’s crotch, some no bigger than a human finger, several as big as a human forearm. They squirmed in midair, their fat, bruise-colored lips puckered tight or gawping wide to fountain viscous streams of glistening drool. Several had latched onto a tagmatic organ hanging stiff beneath Fuck-Antony’s bulk. Slick trails of drool traced the uneven circumference of the appendage.
One of Cephalopatra’s dicktubes had managed to stretch its orifice entirely around the fat anterior section of Fuck-Antony’s cock.
The dicktube slurped greedily; and clamped down imploringly whenever Fuck-Antony’s hips bucked backward; then received the next thrust and swallowed a fraction more of its prize.
Jhansi realized she held both her hands in front of her mouth.
What.
The.
Fuck.
What.
The.
Fuck.
What.
The.
Actual.
Entire.
Goddamned.
Mother.
Fuck.
Jhansi’s exhausted body seethed.
She turned away.
The dark shape grabbed her chin.
{“Keep watching.”}
Jhansi shook her head.
{“I don’t want to!”}
The dark shape laughed.
{“Yes you do.”}
Fuck.
Jhansi swallowed.
Her chest ached.
Her stomach ached.
Her crotch ached.
She covered her eyes with her right hand and peered through her fingers.
The enterprising dicktube swallowed the median section of Fuck-Antony’s cock in one shuddering gulp, the ingress pushing dark capillaries into sharp relief against the monster’s translucent skin.
Thick lips strained in a hilarious expression of avarice.
Jhansi felt sure the thing would snap.
Horrid.
Fuck-Antony let out a rumbling groan. It lurched, then released Cephalopatra’s neck to catch and support itself on both forelimbs. Its pincers squeezed with the movement. It shifted again to settle its weight and get into position to fuck into Cephalopatra from a lowered angle. Its four rear hindlimbs bucked in an even rhythm, each thrust pushing the monster’s cock deep into the other monster’s abdomen and plicating the swollen dicktube.
Cephalopatra arched its back.
Wait.
What?
The monster wrapped all of its tentacles as far around Fuck-Antony as it could reach and pulled.
What?
Cephalopatra rolled its hips forward to meet each thrust from Fuck-Antony.
What.
The.
Fuck?
What the absolute fuck did this mean?
Did Cephalopatra …
Want this?
Did Cephalopatra …
Like … this?
Fuck.
Jhansi’s body felt ready to burst.
What?
What the fuck?
What the fucking fuck did this mean?
Why would …
The dark shape laughed.
{“You know why.”}
Jhansi shook her head hard.
{“Fuck!”}
Fuck-Antony shrugged its shoulders.
It lifted one forelimb, and then the other, to grab a handful of Cephalopatra’s grasping tentacles and pin them against the dirt.
Cephalopatra let out a keening whimper.
The rhythm of its hips intensified.
Fuck-Antony had to adjust to match the new pace.
That …
Really didn’t seem like something prey would do.
So.
Again.
What …
The entire fuck?
How could anything possibly …
Want this?
The dark shape shrugged.
{“You want this.”}
Jhansi clenched her fists.
{“Fuck you!”}
The dark shape laughed.
{“Let’s do a visualization exercise.”}
Jhansi glared.
{“No.”}
The dark shape churned.
{“Imagine–”}
Jhansi shook her head.
{“No.”}
The dark shape continued.
{“–how it would feel–”}
Jhansi shook her head harder.
{“No!”}
The dark shape concluded.
{“–to do that.”}
Fuck-Antony readjusted with a practiced motion, both forearms releasing Cephalopatra while the monster’s haunches flexed to hold upright its thorax and head.
Its pincers spread wide.
A ropey tendril shot from the monster’s feeding orifice in a splattering spray of fluid.
The tendril wrapped around the bulbous dome of Cephalopatra’s head and squeezed.
The amorphous mass reddened and swelled.
Cephalopatra thrashed its tentacles.
In pain?
It bucked its hips.
Of fucking course.
The monster’s dicktubes slurped.
Its beak squawked.
Fuck-Antony grabbed Cephalopatra around the waist with one forelimb and used two digits from the other forelimb to pry open Cephalopatra’s beak.
Cephalopatra’s fat tongue slapped and fumbled around a gargled moan.
Fuck-Antony craned its head.
A long stream of drool spewed directly from its mouth down Cephalopatra’s throat.
Um.
What?!
Cephalopatra choked.
Its body convulsed unpleasantly.
It recoiled from Fuck-Antony for the first time.
Fuck-Antony clamped the beak shut and held it tight.
It wrapped the claws of its other forelimb around the dicktube latched onto its cock–
What the fuck?!
–and, gripping tight, began to push and pull the organ along the length of its shaft.
What?!
Jhansi’s body felt fucking insane.
Her vision doubled.
The dark shape said, {“See?”}
Jhansi wanted to throw up.
Fuck-Antony squeezed harder.
On everything in its grip.
It pumped the dicktube up and down.
With an unforgiving energy.
Glistening, distended lips smeared drool along the irregular surface of Fuck-Antony’s cock.
The monster’s oral tendril went taut.
Veins flared against the fibrous tissue.
The tendril retracted to pull tighter its grip.
Cephalopatra’s head ballooned.
The monster flailed.
With different body language.
Definitely no longer enjoying itself.
… Right?
Jhansi could look away.
Right?
The dark shape smiled.
The pulling tendril lifted Cephalopatra’s head off the dirt.
The monster strained and squirmed uselessly as it folded.
Fuck-Antony released its grip on Cephalopatra’s beak, pulled back its arm, and slapped the bulb of Cephalopatra’s head with crippling force.
Something snapped.
A rush of orange fluid spilled up into Cephalopatra’s head.
What?!
Saliva filled Jhansi’s mouth.
What?!
No.
No no no.
Cephalopatra wailed.
The shrill squawk reverberated.
Jhansi looked away reflexively.
The dark shape washed over her.
Burning hot fingers forced her gaze forward.
{“Watch.”}
Jhansi held her breath.
Fuck-Antony clamped Cephalopatra’s beak closed.
Cephalopatra shuddered violently.
Its abdomen flexed to swallow the fluid still bubbling in its throat.
An erratic delirium emerged.
The monster’s body spasmed with overloaded synapse responses.
Nausea crushed Jhansi.
She felt hot.
So hot.
Sweating?
She dug her fingers into the soft dirt.
Her chest heaved.
Four evenly spaced seams split open lengthwise down Fuck-Antony’s cock.
A rush of steam hissed out from the crevices.
What now?!
Jhansi despaired.
The dark shape leered with vortex eyes.
The carapace of Fuck-Antony’s split open.
Membrous strands stretched taut between the separating segments, then snapped apart.
The orifice of the engulfing dicktube dilated beyond any believable elasticity.
Slick walls of pink flesh pulsated at the terminus.
Something extruded from the open expanse within Fuck-Antony’s cock.
An angrily red, lumpy knob extruded, swelled, and spilled forward to fill the empty space of the carapace.
No.
Fuck.
No.
No!
Fuck-Antony contorted.
It stiffened.
It bellowed.
Fuck.
Cephalopatra arched its back.
Fuck!
Jhansi bit her lip.
Hard.
She squeezed the dirt in her fists.
She squeezed her thighs together.
She squeezed every muscle in her body.
Everything else melted away.
Except for that insistent ache.
Seriously?!
What the ever-living fuck?
She reacts like this, watching a monster fuck the soft life from a pathetic and helpless victim?
What kind of fucking damage did she have?
Jhansi?!
What the fuck?!
The dark shape basked.
Fuck-Antony threw back its head.
It pushed the core of its cock fully into the receptive hole it had created.
And yanked back its tightened tendril.
Every beat of inertia in the clearing caught against the final resistance of Cephalopatra’s abused flesh.
Jhansi whispered, “Please no.”
The dark shape caressed Jhansi’s chin.
Killcolors flashed.
Cephalopatra’s head burst.
A killchime sounded.
Orange blood and white stuff sprayed everywhere.
The mess coated both bodies.
All physical sensation drained away from Jhansi.
Fuck-Antony filled Cephalopatra with ejaculate.
Cephalopatra stiffened.
And contorted.
Jets of clear fluid spurted from every unfilled dicktube.
Jhansi’s body rang with the humming peal of a bell. 
Cephalopatra went limp.
Jhansi’s self-awareness disintegrated.
Static obliterated her interior space.
She didn’t even notice.
Fuck-Antony slumped forward.
It released the corpse’s beak and caught itself with the same forelimb.
Orange blood splashed.
Fuck-Antony panted.
Its back heaved.
It waited.
Then turned to scan the clearing.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Oh fuck!
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!
What if it turned toward Jhansi?
Jhansi’s eyes bulged.
An indescribable rush howled through her body.
Fuck-Antony chittered.
It turned sluggishly to look over one shoulder, then the other.
Its cock twitched.
The core diminished and receded.
Ejaculate oozed from the slackening maw of the dicktube.
Fuck-Antony grabbed the limp organ and pulled it free.
Sludgey discharge spewed.
Fuck-Antony stared.
Then turned to the corpse.
Ruptured anatomy formed a strange shoreline against the pool of orange blood and stuff that soaked slowly into the earth.
Fuck-Antony tossed the dicktube onto the body with a wet splat.
More ejaculate gushed.
Jhansi shook.
Rotten.
Rotten.
Rotten.
Fuck-Antony lurched onto all fours and lumbered away into the night.
Fuck.
Jhansi watched its shape move between the narrow trees.
Fuck.
The monster dissolved into shadow.
Fuck …
The sound of crunching brush faded.
Jhansi heard herself exhale.
A feeling like biting wracked her entire body.
She shuddered and jerked.
And toppled forward into the dirt.
She laid still.
And exhaled again.
Her senses came back to her in waves.
She felt the cool earth against her cheek.
And heard the soft roar of the bay.
And smelled the copper rot stench of death.
Fuck.
Jhansi drooled a little.
What.
The.
Fuck?!
What the fuck?!
Jhansi took a long, steadying breath.
And then another.
And another.
The dark shape smiled.
{“Enjoy yourself?”}
Jhansi shook her head.
{“Don’t.”}
She didn’t have the strength for more.
The dark shape laughed.
{“Don’t worry.”}
It drifted closer.
{“I know how you feel.”}
Jhansi shook her head again.
{“Fuck off.”}
The dark shape shrugged.
Jhansi squeezed the dirt.
What …
What the hell?
What the fucking hell?!
What the absolute fucking hell could she possibly do to deal with any of that?!
What the fuck did any of it mean?
The throes of the alterling’s death flashed in Jhansi’s mind.
Bile rose.
Heat filled her stomach.
Pain filled her crotch.
What the fuck kind of reaction–
The dark shape stared.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jhansi shook her head.
No.
None of that.
No.
Nope.
It didn’t matter.
It couldn’t matter.
Good guys didn’t have thoughts like that.
Fuck.
No.
Move on.
Jhansi shook her head again.
She pushed herself upright.
She looked at the corpse, then toward the beach.
How much time had Jhansi spent watching that scene?
Fuck.
What about the half hour time limit?
Fuck!
Would the Asterlings leave without her?
Probably not.
Would they berate her for making them wait?
Oh for sure.
Sonofabitch.
Jhansi said, “Fuck.”
She blanched and covered her mouth.
Nothing moved.
Jhansi exhaled.
She stood.
The path back to the beach beckoned.
Just a short hike away, special ones danced in a ring of light and shared their bodies with each other.
Images of the party flooded Jhansi’s mind.
Everything that had driven her out here.
To witness this.
Jhansi clenched her fists.
Fuck it.
So what if she made them wait?
They might have time to fuck around, but she had responsibilities to fulfill.
She had a fucking world to save.
And after this, she’d have something to show for her half hour.
Unlike those slackoff fuckwits.
Jhansi crossed the clearing and knelt beside the corpse.
It seemed so much bigger up close.
Like everything else.
And.
She couldn’t keep herself from looking.
The abused dicktube lay in a sloppy pile, its wide orifice leaking foul matter.
The abdominal beak hung open, its sharp curves bearing a pool of blood that cooled against a bloated tongue.
The exploded head–
Fuck.
Don’t think about it.
Just.
Do it.
Jhansi shuddered.
She held up her right hand, inhaled, and plunged her arm into the rent corpse.
The familiar sensation.
Stuff squished and yielded between her fingers as she pressed deeper.
Why hadn’t Fuck-Antony taken the memory card?
Something to do with the way alterlings changed?
Cephalopatra possessed some characteristic that Fuck-Antony didn’t want to take into itself?
Well.
Fair.
Jhansi scowled.
Her hand brushed against something hard. She grabbed it and pulled. Orange stuff bubbled in her wake.
Jhansi stood, shook the card free of viscera, and held it up toward the thin moon grinning down through the canopy.
What memories did it contain?
Well.
Probably not good ones.
Jhansi looked down at the corpse. She sighed. She looked around the clearing, then back toward the beach. Her shoulders sagged.
Should she new-game-plus Cephalopatra?
What would Binyelum say?
Well.
Did the Asterlings really need this memory card?
The IDON flashed through Jhansi’s mind.
She swallowed.
She sighed.
“I’m sorry.”
Jhansi clutched the memory card against her chest, turned from the corpse, and retraced her steps back to the beach.
She paused.
Something felt different.
Almost imperceptibly so, but definitely different.
Jhansi stepped up to the shoreline.
Nothing living moved across her vision.
Hushed waves deposited swiftly fading patterns in the sand.
The moon gleamed high and bright.
The cloak–
Oh.
Damn.
Jhansi could see further.
Only by a margin.
But.
Still.
Wait.
Fuck.
What did that mean?
A brighter moon?
Double fuck.
Seriously, how much time had she spent out here?
Triple fuck.
Jhansi hurried.
She splashed past the culvert.
Paw prints stippled the beach.
What?
More?
They led toward the party.
And then just.
Stopped.
What the fuck?
Jhansi looked around.
Nothing.
Except.
The arch of driftwood looming at the edge of the cloak.
No silhouette darkened as Jhansi approached.
But she noticed something else.
Patterns of deep notches lined the wood.
Jhansi stepped closer and ran her hand along the splintered topography.
The notches further from the shoreline felt wild and uneven, but they gained regularity and certainty closer to the water.
Nancy had spent that time practicing with her ax.
Oh.
Holy shit.
Jhansi blinked.
Nancy really had a whole fucking thing, huh?
Wow.
Well.
Fuck.
At least Jhansi didn’t have to fight Nancy.
The number of cars surrounding the party had grown during Jhansi's absence. Almost twice as many bodies pressed against each other in the swirling lights. Several smaller groups of special ones congregated outside the glaring headlights, engaged in activities Jhansi couldn't discern.
Fuck.
Okay.
Time to find the Asterlings.
A voice called from behind Jhansi.
“Hey!”
Jhansi turned reflexively.
Stupid.
Probably not even someone addressing her.
A figure jogged down the beach.
Jhansi recognized the smooth, lanky gait.
Holy shit.
Binyelum said, “There you fucking are.”
Light winked off the gold blush dusted across Binyelum's cheeks.
Wait.
Jhansi looked around.
Binyelum and Jhansi stood alone together.
For the first time since The Rescue.
Jhansi’s eyes widened.
Her entire body tensed.
Binyelum carried a dark expression.
“Fucking pejudo lo anmo.”
They exhaled through their nose.
“You're okay.”
Jhansi's stomach roiled.
Binyelum had gone looking for her.
She’d worried them.
Had she done something wrong?
Well, she would’ve stayed put if Binyelum hadn't brought her to a goddamn degenerate party that fundamentally excluded her.
Fuck!
And how exactly had Binyelum spent their time?
They had conceived this whole fucking spectacle, after all.
They had seemed pretty fucking excited about it.
So, what?
Binyelum and The Doll had done whatever the goddamned fuck while Jhansi sat with her consolation prize–watching one nightmare creature fuck another to death.
Fuck!
And why not?
Jhansi could never compete with someone like The Doll.
Jhansi didn’t even fucking belong here.
Holy shit.
What a fucking loser.
Static exploded.
Every searing band dug deep into the raw, beaten walls of Jhansi’s interior space.
Jhansi’s teeth clacked together.
“Yep. Here I fucking am. One-hundred percent a-okay. Definitely didn't get fucked up or traumatized while you were off making out with some dumb fucking party bimbo.”
Binyelum blinked.
“What?”
They narrowed their eyes.
“Jhansi, what’s your problem?”
They shook their head.
“What's with the shorts?”
They made a face.
“What the fuck have you been doing?”
Wow.
An interrogation.
Beautiful.
Jhansi said, “I don't have a problem.”
Binyelum glowered.
“Jhansi.”
They gestured wide.
“I thought you were fucking dead.”
So what?
Jhansi deadpanned, “Be easier for you if I was.”
Binyelum groaned.
“What the fuck, for real.”
Jhansi scoffed.
And looked away.
“I'm literally the weakest fucking thing here.”
She paused.
Then sighed.
“I can't even have fun like you guys.”
She looked back at Binyelum.
“What's the fucking point?”
Binyelum stared.
“Jhansi–”
Jhansi interrupted.
“Just fucking replace me with what’s-her-tits, you’d all have way more fun.”
Binyelum snorted.
“What’s-her-tits?”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“I got these shorts from a girl–”
She shook her head.
“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t fucking matter!”
Jhansi stepped toward the water.
“I don’t belong here.”
Silence filled the interstice.
Binyelum stepped forward.
“Jhansi.”
They spoke softly.
“What happened? Where were you?”
Ugh.
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
Binyelum tensed.
“Did something happen at the party? Did someone fuck with you?”
Jhansi shook her head curtly.
“Didn’t go to the party.”
Binyelum frowned.
“Jhansi …”
They looked around the beach.
“Jhansi, why didn’t you go to the party?”
Why the fuck indeed?
Static stabbed up through Jhansi’s chin and lifted her from the floor of her interior space.
Spots danced across her vision.
She clenched her fists.
“It’s just not a place where I belong!”
Binyelum watched Jhansi.
They cocked their head.
“Why?”
Ugh!
Jhansi groaned.
“Look at me!”
She gestured up and down her body.
“I’m. Fucking. Lame. Biyelum!”
She paused.
“Nobody fucking likes me!”
Binyelum blinked.
Then chuckled.
A smile crept across their face.
They burst fully into a sparkling laugh.
“You fucking dumbass.”
They held their sides and shook their head.
What?
What the hell?
Jhansi made a face.
“What the hell, Binyelum?!”
Binyelum shook their head again.
“You absolute idiot.”
They wiped a welling tear from their eyes.
“I like you.”
What?!
Static battered Jhansi from every direction.
Heat rose on her face and filled her entire body.
Incredulous tears sprang into her eyes.
Nope!
No way!
Jhansi took a step back.
“What? What the fuck does that mean?”
Binyelum smiled warmly.
“You fucking bozo.”
They gestured.
“I like having you on the team. I like when you’re around. I like the person that you are with all of us.”
What?
Well.
Fine.
Sure.
They had their reasons.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“You just like me because I’m useful.”
Binyelum snorted.
“Useful?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes harder.
“You know.”
Binyelum blinked and shrugged.
Ugh!
Jhansi gestured between them.
“The special thing.”
She gestured up at the moon.
“The thing we’re doing tonight.”
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
They looked up toward the moon.
Then at Jhansi.
Then back toward the moon.
Then back at Jhansi.
They chuckled.
“Tryhardling–”
They paused.
“–I like you–”
What?!
Jhansi opened her mouth.
Binyelum framed Jhansi’s face with both hands.
“–because you’re fucking insane.”
Double what?!
Jhansi blinked.
“Insane!”
She shook her head.
“I’m not insane!”
Binyelum laughed.
“Jhansi! Exactly!”
They gestured up and down Jhansi’s body.
“You take everything so fucking seriously.”
They held their limbs stiff and wobbled in place.
“Grrr. I’m Jhansi. I’m the most perfect good girl of all time! I’m gonna save the entire fucking world! Don’t tease me about it or I’ll shit out one-hundred-thousand metric tons of TNT!”
Triple what?!
No.
Absolutely not.
Jhansi stamped her foot.
“That’s not–”
Binyelum smirked.
Ugh.
Jhansi waved her arms.
“Fine! Well!”
She raised her hands up behind her head to mimic animal ears and leapt from side to side.
“Blehhh! I’m Binyelum! I’ve studied the game from every angle imaginable and mastered the art of adaptability; I instinctively know all the best traits of my teammates and always understand how best to put them to use; I never fail to save the day in the absolute most theatrically dramatic fashion fucking possible because I’m just that smart and cool and perfect.”
She struck a pose and pointed at Binyelum.
“You’re insane too!”
Binyelum blinked.
Then paused.
Then blinked again.
Then cocked their head.
“You really think that about me?”
What?
Jhansi made a face.
“Well yeah.”
She shrugged.
“Duh.”
She waved one arm behind her.
“Where have you been?”
She brought her arm back around and counted on her fingers.
“The Rescue. Bridgemall. Bridgemall again. Bridgemall fucking again. The jump at the bridge.”
She held up her other hand.
“And then the Strawberri fucking Eight!”
She waggled both her hands.
“That’s more than a whole hand, Binyelum!”
Binyelum smiled softly.
They looked away to the horizon, then up to the knife edge of the moon.
Their eyes went unfocused.
Shit.
Had Jhansi said something wrong?
Binyelum shook their head.
Their smile warmed.
“None of that would have been possible without everyone working together.”
They nodded.
“We’re a team.”
Moonlight glittered against their cheeks.
Ugh.
Humility now?
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“Funny how your ego’s a no-show when someone gives you an actual compliment.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
Fuck!
Jhansi waved her hands.
“What I’m trying to say is, the miracles are obviously yours. No one can dispute that.”
Binyelum blinked slowly.
Then smirked.
And chuckled once.
Their jacket fluttered lightly in the breeze.
Their fists clenched and unclenched.
Jhansi’s chest ached.
Binyelum said, “You really do feel that way.”
It didn't sound like a question this time.
Jhansi repeated her answer anyway.
“Yes, I do.”
Binyelum shook their head.
They gave Jhansi a dark smile.
“I'm not perfect.”
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“I didn't say you were.” 
Binyelum snorted.
“Yes you did.”
Ugh.
Of course they would remember that.
Jhansi huffed.
“Whatever.”
She gestured.
“You take care of everyone. We're all able to do cool shit because you believe in us. You're like–”
She waggled her arm into a salute.
“A real leader.”
She shrugged.
“You know?”
Binyelum scoffed.
“A real leader?”
They smirked.
“What’s that mean to you?”
Of fucking course.
Jhansi shook her head.
“You just cannot help yourself, can you?”
She sighed.
“You–”
She paused.
Oren’s words flashed through her mind.
Binyelum stared through her silence. Their eyes narrowed and widened at intervals. Their pupils dilated and contracted. 
Jhansi fidgeted.
“You don’t treat the people who follow you as though they’re expendable.”
She nodded.
“You treat them like real living creatures.”
Binyelum blinked.
Their expression fell into stark neutrality.
They looked away from Jhansi.
What?
Binyelum toed the sand.
They pushed a heavy sigh out into the night.
Then stuffed their hands into the pockets of their jacket and bent at the waist.
And lamented at the sand.
“Fuck me to death.”
What the hell?
Jhansi frowned.
“Are–”
Binyelum righted themselves.
Their gaze pierced straight through Jhansi’s skull.
“I sacrificed someone’s life tonight.”
Wait.
What?
Jhansi shook her head.
“What?”
She shook her head again.
“Who?”
Binyelum blinked slowly.
“Terry.”
Huh?
Jhansi shook her head once again.
“Who?”
Binyelum blinked again.
“Scuba gear.”
Oh.
Oh!
Oh?
What?
Jhansi frowned.
“You didn’t kill them.”
Binyelum sighed.
“I didn’t say that I did.”
Their expression fell toward melancholy.
“I said that I sacrificed them.”
Hang on.
Guilt?
This didn’t feel like Binyelum at all.
Jhansi crossed her arms.
“Binyelum, you had Sebastian share his gift in order to heal them.”
She shrugged.
“It’s not your fault they weren’t good enough.”
Binyelum gave her the gentlest of smiles.
“I also threw them out of formation in the middle of a high intensity encounter with very little margin for error.”
They paused.
“Specifically in order to put them in a kind of danger that would take them out of the running and make it possible for us to achieve our goal.”
Okay.
And?
Jhansi shook her head.
“You did what you thought was right.”
Binyelum raised both eyebrows.
They blinked.
They stared at Jhansi.
They almost looked away.
The gentle smile returned.
Their eyes pulled at the world.
“I used them, Jhansi.”
Wait.
Jhansi blinked.
She opened her mouth.
Binyelum shook their head.
“It’s not different, Jhansi.”
Double wait.
Why did they keep doing this?
Jhansi frowned.
“It’s not like you tried to get them killed.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Yeah, Jhansi, I kinda did.”
Triple wait.
What the hell?
Jhansi’s chest tightened.
“Why are you doing this?”
Binyelum stared.
They chewed their lip.
Then sighed.
And looked away.
“You have this idea of me in your head.”
They paused.
“I just want to prepare you for when that idea collapses.”
They dug a shoe into the sand.
“I’m not who you think I am.”
Okay.
Enough of this.
Jhansi leaned forward.
“Is this about that stuff between you and Oren?”
Binyelum’s expression darkened.
They failed to mask the ugly frown that pulled at the corners of their mouth and eyes.
Malice glinted along the sharp edges of their face.
“What?”
Yikes.
Jhansi waved her hands.
“I didn't overhear much!”
She ignored Binyelum's growing snarl and pressed ahead.
“I just–”
Just what, exactly?
What did she mean?
How did she really feel?
Jhansi paused.
She collected her thoughts.
She had done this with Oren.
She could do it with Binyelum.
Jhansi nodded.
“You haven't done anything at all tonight to make me feel like you're anyone other than–”
She gestured up and down.
“–this.”
Fuck.
Nice work.
What a rousing fucking speech.
Binyelum stared.
Jhansi held her breath.
Binyelum exhaled slowly.
“You're telling me to let it go?”
They raised both eyebrows.
Somehow the expression seemed …
Aggressive.
Shit.
Jhansi’s certainty flickered.
Static hummed to life.
Jhansi stared at Binyelum.
“Uh.”
She shrugged.
“Yeah?”
Binyelum snorted.
“Tryhardling Jhansi, the fucking queen of letting things go.”
What?!
Static speared straight through Jhansi's chest.
She clenched her fists.
“What?”
Binyelum smirked.
They shook their head.
“I could make you melt down in a heartbeat.”
Shit.
Fuck.
What the fuck?
Another spear of static, this one gouging and twisting as it pushed through.
Water threatened behind Jhansi's eyes.
Binyelum held up an open palm.
“I can't even count on one hand–”
They took a step forward.
Their mouth spread into a hungry leer.
“–the number of choices you’ve made tonight–”
They took another step forward.
Their eyes filled the entire sky.
“–that would send you into fucking hysterics–”
They took another step forward and Jhansi backed away.
“–if I so much as alluded to them in front of the others.”
What.
The.
Fuck?!
Static detonated.
Jagged shards of voltage blistered Jhansi's interior space.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Do not fucking cry.
Jhansi barely bit back a shriek.
“Fuck you!”
Binyelum chuckled.
“See?”
Ugh!
What the–
Fuck!
Motherfucker!
This time Jhansi did shriek.
“Why the fuck are you doing this?!”
Do.
Not.
Cry.
Jhansi gestured wildly.
“I was just trying to tell you that I believe in you!”
Binyelum took yet another step toward Jhansi.
They raised both hands, their fingers locked into curves like claws.
A low hiss rumbled from their throat.
Jhansi froze.
She felt her eyes bulge.
Her heart pounded as loud as the surging static.
Shit.
What?
Should Jhansi run?
Binyelum blinked.
They deflated.
Their arms fell to their sides and their shoulders sagged.
They turned their back to Jhansi.
“And I’m trying to show you that's not a good idea.”
What the entire fuck?
A wounded anger smoldered in the wake of dissipating static.
Jhansi narrowed her eyes.
“Oren said you were dishonest about your feelings.”
Binyelum turned, their eyebrows already raised.
“You talked to Oren about me.”
Not a question.
Jhansi shrugged.
Binyelum nodded.
They clicked their tongue.
And looked toward the party.
“We were the Dark Hearts Akimbo.”
They nodded.
“Myself, Oren, and–”
An almost imperceptible pause.
“–Cherry.”
A longer pause.
Much longer.
Jhansi waited.
Binyelum shuddered, as though something had shoved their awareness back into their body.
They turned a delicate smile on Jhansi.
“You still think I can do this?”
Ugh.
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
She opened her mouth, closed it, and opened it again.
“Yes.”
Binyelum's smile swelled by a single degree.
“Guess we’ll have to see, believeling.”
They turned without another word and headed for the party.
Jhansi blinked after them.
What?
What had any of that meant?
Fucking hell.
They always fucking did that.
Jhansi trotted behind Binyelum.
The sensory assault from the party intensified.
They passed a cluster of maybe two dozen teenagers loitering outside the party. Those not already bobbing their head stood looking toward the center with an assortment of expectant expressions. A dark-haired teenager wearing blue and red baseball paraphernalia and a blonde teenager in a lilac sundress received the attention.
Garden Lily beamed through the wildly long curls that fell in swaying trajectories across their face.
Grand Slam returned the expression and grabbed Garden Lily’s hand.
Their baseball cap pulsed and dimmed.
The blare of a saxophone erupted from Garden Lily’s mouth.
Jhansi recognized the tune, a playful earworm from a bar scene in an old science fiction movie.
The music clashed against the rhythmic thudding from the party, but everyone here found the beat.
They leaned into the silliness of the moment, laughing and waving their arms.
Grand Slam and Garden Lily had eyes for no one but each other.
Jhansi’s chest twinged.
She almost walked straight into the bumper of a dark Ford.
Fuck.
She steeled herself and followed Binyelum back into the heart of the party.
Hero’s A Cheerleader had finished their set and a different pair of special ones had taken the stage, one wearing an oversized t-shirt printed with a voluptuous, pixelated woman shaking her ass, the other wearing a crop top embroidered with a frozen crescent moon.
Wordless music decimated Jhansi’s senses.
They found Nancy dancing near the edge of the crowd, eyes closed, hips swaying, single arm cutting long shapes in midair.
Everyone gave her a wide berth.
Binyelum touched her shoulder.
She turned, her neutral expression contrasting sharply against the intensity of her dancing.
Binyelum and Nancy stared at each other.
Binyelum leaned in and said something Jhansi couldn’t hear.
Nancy pointed.
The three of them followed Nancy’s gesture a short ways through a congestion of bodies.
Sebastian sat slouched on the hood of a red Integra, his chin resting in both his palms.
He glanced up as Binyelum approached, then spotted Nancy and hurriedly looked away.
Binyelum smiled.
They leaned in and said something Jhansi couldn’t hear.
Sebastian nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and pointedly kept his gaze turned away from Nancy.
The four of them pressed onward.
Jhansi kept her gaze focused on Binyelum’s back.
They found Oren holding hands and dancing with the same teenager that had pulled him away a thousand years ago.
Binyelum touched his shoulder.
He turned a rapidly shifting expression away from his dance partner.
His brows pulled in, then shot up.
He smiled warmly, then wanly.
His mouth quirked downward, and the corners of his eyes followed close behind.
Binyelum and Oren stared at each other.
Oren turned back to the other teenager.
His chest rose, then fell with an inexorable crush.
He said something Jhansi couldn’t hear.
But she could read the words.
“Be seeing you.”
The other teenager smiled back.
Shimmering loops of color whirled across their eyes.
Oren fell in with the Asterlings.
Velocity proved unexpectedly elusive.
Well.
Maybe not so unexpected.
They scoured the party twice before finding their final member in a corner furthest from the lights, with their back turned to the crowd and both their hands massaging the shoulders of a small teenager draped in their jersey.
Velocity hadn’t put on anything to replace the garment.
Jhansi kept her eyes averted.
Binyelm tapped Velocity’s shoulder.
Velocity turned.
A grin curved across their face.
They leaned in toward their …
… dance partner?
And said something Jhansi couldn’t hear.
Small Treasure looked up with swimming eyes.
Velocity kissed the top of their head.
They raised their arms and Velocity retrieved their jersey.
Velocity retrieved something else, too, from a spot in the scraggy grass.
A weighted rectangle with a dangling strap.
A Kodak Instamatic X-15, mounted with a watchful, glassy Magicube flash.
Velocity dressed themselves and joined the Asterlings.
Binyelum grinned at everyone in turn.
They nodded, gestured, and led everyone back to Mambele.
Holy shit.
It felt so weird.
Everyone together again.
Jhansi had …
… really missed it?
They passed through the line of cars and spread out as they walked across the beach.
Nobody spoke.
Jhansi looked around.
Should she say something?
Binyelum nodded.
“Everyone get some quality r and r?”
Velocity flexed.
“I got my rights and my wrongs.”
Binyelum made a mouth noise.
Sebastian said, “Are you fucking serious?”
Velocity’s expression fell.
“You have a problem, faschy?”
Sebastian blinked.
Then his lip curled.
Oren turned to face them both.
“Velocity, just let it go.”
Hang on.
His t-shirt changed.
It depicted a sandcastle.
Velocity’s expression fell further.
“Really?”
Oren nodded.
“Yes.”
He shook his head.
“We’re not who we were.”
Velocity paused.
They narrowed their eyes.
“What do you know?”
Oren shook his head.
“If Sebastian didn’t want to be here, he wouldn’t be here.”
Velocity made a face.
“That doesn’t change–”
Oren interrupted.
“No. It doesn’t. But right now we’re here.”
He paused.
“And soon, we’re going to be dead.”
He paused again.
“Who do you want to be between now and then?”
Velocity stared.
Sebastian blinked.
Nobody spoke.
Wow.
Velocity shrugged.
They dragged their feet and kicked up sand.
Their pendant glittered.
They exhaled.
“Fine.”
They turned to Sebastian.
“But if we make it through the night, I’m beating the shit out of you.”
Sebastian stared.
He chuckled darkly.
“Velocity.”
He paused.
And let it drag on.
“You can only hit me once.”
Light spun across Velocity’s grin.
They rubbed their chin.
“That’s all I need.”
Oren waved a hand.
“We’re done.”
Velocity rolled their eyes.
“Fine.”
Nobody spoke.
Wow.
Holy shit.
Whew.
Binyelum turned and walked backward.
They gestured theatrically.
“Friends, I want to hear about the growing legacy of the Asterlings.”
They spread their arms wide.
“For my part, I overheard that the Persistent Flame of the Bloodshot Eye are swarming the Strawberri Eight.”
They grinned.
“What the hell did all of you get up to?”
Wait.
What?
Everyone made a different face.
Velocity said, “We’re really out here making a difference, aren’t we?”
Sebastian frowned.
“Wonderful.”
Oren blinked.
“So that alterling was a project of theirs?”
Nancy stared impassively.
Binyelum clicked their tongue.
“So modest, all of you.”
They shook their head.
Hang on.
Project?
Jhansi looked around.
“What project?”
Oren opened his mouth.
Sebastian groaned.
“Do we have to?”
Ugh!
Binyelum snorted.
Double ugh!
Sebastian shrugged forcefully.
Triple ugh!
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
“Forget it.”
Oren shook his head.
“Imagine if you figured out how to architect the experiences of an endling or alterling to always produce a special one with a predetermined gift. Imagine if you figured out how to engineer some incredibly powerful gifts. Invisibility. Telepathy.”
Wait.
What?
Holy–
Wow.
Holy shit.
Jhansi shook her head.
“That’s fucked.”
She blinked.
“And you think that alterling–”
She pointed.
“–was one of those projects?”
Binyelum smiled.
“Looks like.”
Oh.
Holy shit.
Jhansi chuckled.
“I bet they’re pissed.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“Delighted to have their attention.”
Binyelum smirked and slapped Sebastian’s shoulder.
“Come on. We’re telling a story.”
They gestured.
“Which brings me all the way back to my question. What the hell did everyone get up to?”
Sebastian gestured at Velocity with his thumb.
“New gear.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Yes.”
They raised their eyebrows at Velocity.
“You stole that?”
Velocity laughed.
“What a generous assessment of my character, boss.”
Binyelum smiled.
They shrugged.
“Does it work?”
Velocity held it up against the dark sky.
Bright lines of color moved across the hard edges.
Velocity shrugged.
“Doesn’t matter. Can’t develop the film.”
Why?
Oh.
Right.
A pause hung in the air.
Binyelum shook their head.
“That's fine. Does it work?”
Velocity shrugged again.
“None of it needs batteries. I tried it once and everything clicked and clacked like it's supposed to. Flash is fucking bright. There's–”
They gestured with the camera’s refractive, cubic crown.
“–three flashes left.”
Binyelum grinned.
“Then let's do it.”
Velocity blinked.
A smile slowly pulled itself into place.
“Sure.”
They nodded behind Binyelum.
“On the hood.”
Mambele sat quiet against the water, her dark angles blurring into vesper waves.
Nobody argued.
Binyelum grabbed the camera from Velocity.
“My arms are longest.”
Velocity shrugged.
They clambered up onto the hood first and reclined against the windshield with their hands behind their head.
Nancy followed and sat with a deadpan expression and a single thumb up.
Oren and Sebastian looked at each other, then climbed up and sat beside each other.
Sebastian gave the devil’s horns with both hands.
Oren smiled.
Binyelum nodded at Jhansi.
“Come on, princess.”
Oh.
Fuck!
Heat rushed across Jhansi’s face.
She scrambled up onto the hood.
Sebastian looked at her.
“What’s with the shorts?”
Ugh.
Jhansi glared.
“They don’t have pee on them.”
Sebastian snorted.
“Not yet.”
Ugh!
Jhansi rolled her eyes.
Binyelum leaned with one arm against the hood and held the camera as far out as they could reach.
Velocity said, “The lens cap is on, boss.”
Binyelum looked over their shoulder.
“What keen eyes you have.”
Velocity tapped the top of their head.
“It’s the gift.”
Binyelum fixed the camera.
A wild dance played across their titanic grin.
“Everybody say it on three!”
Jhansi held her breath.
“One!”
Binyelum stretched just a little further.
“Two!”
The moon leered above.
Everyone said, “Die like a star!”
The camera’s shutter whirred.
The flash raked across the scene.
Fuck!
Jhansi saw stars.
Sebastian shouted, “Wow!”
He shook his head.
“Don’t know why I didn't expect that.”
He gestured.
“Where’d you find that anyway?”
Velocity grabbed their camera.
They stood on Mambele’s hood and blinked down on Sebastian.
They paused.
A knowing smile spread soft across their face.
“The shift provideth.”
Sebastian blinked.
Then snorted.
Oren pressed his palms into his watering eyes.
“I dunno, I think it’s cool.”
Velocity gestured.
“Thank you!”
Binyelum clapped their hands.
“Alright!”
Everyone turned to look at them.
They beckoned with both hands.
“Come on down, come on down.”
Everyone looked at each other, shrugged, and dismounted Mambele.
Binyelum nodded.
“Good good, yes yes.”
Everyone looked at each other again.
Binyelum gestured.
“There’s no better way to do this, so I’m just gonna play all my cards.”
They spun fully around.
Their dragging foot dug a trench down into dark sand.
“Kiran was–”
Oh right.
Kiran.
Binyelum struck a pose, their legs straddling the beach, one arm thrown back and the other flourished forward.
“–taken by the Mesonoxian!”
Hang on.
Nobody spoke.
The Asterlings all looked at each other.
Sebastian burst into laughter.
Binyelum smiled.
“I’m not joking.”
Sebastian doubled over.
And shook his head.
He guffawed.
Then leaned back and ran both hands across his face.
And yelled into the sky.
“People just don’t love anymore!”
He chuckled.
And gave Binyelum a tired smile.
“No, Binyelum, I didn't think you were joking.”
Binyelum kept smiling.
Velocity frowned.
“You are joking, right?”
Binyelum shook their head.
They kept smiling.
“I literally just said I’m not.”
Velocity blinked.
They sighed.
“Fuck.”
They turned away and kicked up a huge cloud of sand.
“Fuck!”
Oren ran a hand through his hair.
“Yeah.”
He shook his head.
“Fuck.”
Nancy stared impassively
Oren reiterated, “Fuck.”
Everyone fell silent and exchanged uncertain glances.
Hang the fuck on.
Jhansi said, “What the hell does this mean?”
Everyone turned to look at her.
Jhansi looked from Oren to Velocity.
“You guys kinda explained it to me before, the Mes–”
Velocity interrupted.
“Dude, don't keep saying its name.”
Jhansi gave them a look.
“The …”
She searched her mind for a suitable nickname.
“… Big M?”
Velocity snorted.
“Sure.”
Jhansi continued.
“Right. You told me the Big M is …”
Right.
“… despair itself.”
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
“And that means that it … takes people?”
Binyelum looked at Velocity.
“Despair itself, huh?”
Velocity made a face.
“Yes?”
Binyelum nodded.
They looked at Jhansi.
“Despair doesn't take people?”
Oh come on.
Jhansi made a face.
“You know what I mean.”
Oren said, “The Big M is an immortal monster that captures and imprisons special ones for the duration of the netherlume shift.”
He paused.
“The more special ones it has in its possession, the stronger it becomes.”
Oh.
Um.
Okay.
Jhansi blinked.
“Imprisons?”
She shook her head.
“Where? How?”
Oren gestured out over the water.
“It has a stronghold out past the Portvaktens Palats.”
Jhansi followed Oren's gesture.
“A stronghold? Something it built?”
Oren nodded.
Fascinating.
Jhansi looked at Binyelum.
“So how do we get out there?”
Everyone looked at her.
Nancy, neutral as always.
Sebastian, eyes wide.
Velocity, glowering.
Oren, bewildered.
Binyelum, beaming.
Sebastian said, “Hold the fuck up.”
Velocity directed their glower toward Sebastian.
“Dude, seriously?”
Sebastian glowered back.
“Yes seriously.”
He gestured.
“Are you fucking insane? Do you have a death–”
He looked at Binyelum.
“Do not fucking say it.”
Binyelum shrugged.
“Being alive is a deathwish.”
Sebastian flailed.
“What is it with you people?!”
Velocity hissed at Oren.
“We’re not who we were, huh?”
Oren shook his head.
“He’ll come around.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“Fuck.”
He shook his head.
“I am not fucking doing this.”
Binyelum sighed quietly.
“You’re not coming to help your friend?”
Sebastian’s eyes bugged out.
He blinked.
“Fuck!”
He swept a fist through the air.
“How the fuck do you think this is going to go?!”
Binyelum shook their head.
“I’m not suggesting we fight the ‘Nox.”
Sebastian snorted.
“The ‘Nox.”
He shook his head.
“So what, you're gonna ask it pretty please?”
Binyelum smiled.
“It’s a stealth mission.”
Sebastian paused.
He narrowed his eyes.
“You think you can sneak past the Mesonoxian.”
Not a question.
Binyelum nodded.
“I think I can sneak past the Moxxy Noxxy.”
Sebastian shook his head and chuckled.
“That's stupid.”
Binyelum narrowed their eyes.
“What are you afraid of?”
Sebastian groaned.
“I'm afraid of fucking death, Binyelum! You know? The end? The violent and tortuous conclusion of our entire existence?”
Binyelum nodded.
“I understand. I don't want you to die either.”
They paused.
Then gestured behind them at the expansive night.
“What would you like to do with your final night in the netherlume shift instead?”
Sebastian stared at the party.
Then looked out over the water.
Then up at the moon.
“That's not fair.”
Binyelum took a step forward.
“Life isn't fair.”
Sebastian gritted his teeth.
He smacked his forehead with both fists.
Twice.
“Fuck!”
Oren put a hand on his shoulder.
“You don't have to do it alone.”
Sebastian shrugged off the hand.
“That's–”
He gestured.
“–the entire fucking problem!”
He groaned.
“I don't want to watch my friends fucking die again!”
Oh yikes.
Everyone fell silent.
Velocity nodded.
“Thought you said they abandoned you.”
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“Not …”
He shook his head.
“… all of them.”
Binyelum exhaled.
“I'm really sorry you had to go through that.”
Sebastian shook his head again.
“It's …”
He gestured.
“... whatever.”
He gestured again.
“It's …”
He gestured once again.
“… how things go.”
He sighed.
And gestured yet again.
“You all went through it too. I’m not special.”
Binyelum said, “It's okay to be sensitive.”
Sebastian blurted, “I know!”
He glanced at Jhansi.
Then sighed at Binyelum.
“I know how we can get out there.”
Wait.
Nancy stared.
Velocity sighed.
“Pej.”
Oren smirked.
“Figures.”
Sebastian looked around.
“Hang on. You guys just fed me a bunch of frosted shit flakes!”
Nancy glared.
Velocity chuckled darkly.
“Yeah, but I didn't think we’d actually have to do it.”
Oren nodded and shrugged.
“Same.”
Sebastian laughed.
“Fuck you guys straight through concrete.”
Wow.
Binyelum waved a beckoning hand.
“Don't leave us hanging.”
Sebastian nodded.
“Right.”
He pointed his thumb at Mambele.
“Mambele can transform.”
Everyone blinked.
Binyelum smiled and narrowed their eyes.
“Now where did you learn a trick like that?”
Sebastian returned the smile.
“I saw it.”
He gestured out over the water.
“Naval endling, remember?”
Binyelum nodded slowly.
“Right.”
They brought a finger to their chin.
“The Persistent Flame of the Bloodshot Eye?”
Sebastian shook his head.
“They probably know how, but no. It was the Things We Carry.”
Binyelum whistled.
Oren said, “You actually saw them? As an endling?”
Sebastian shrugged.
“We were on the water. They passed beneath us.”
Binyelum cocked their head and leaned forward.
“Like in a submarine?”
Sebastian nodded.
“Exactly.”
Binyelum cocked their head to the other side.
“How do you know it was the Things We Carry?”
Sebastian shrugged.
“We're all pretty easy to tell apart out here.”
Binyelum laughed.
“True.”
Oren asked, “How does it work?”
Sebastian shook his head.
“No fucking idea.”
Velocity clenched both fists.
“Hallelujah.”
Binyelum rubbed their chin.
“We’ll have to talk to the Things We Carry.”
Oren looked at them.
“How?”
Nancy stepped forward.
Everyone else blinked.
Nancy knelt.
She traced an image in the sand with the same graceful and certain brutality she used to swing her ax.
Three squat, conjoined rectangles appeared, followed by a trailing line that ended in a starburst.
Nancy stood, looked around, and gestured.
Everyone else blinked again.
Binyelum said, “A flare gun.”
Oren shook his head.
“Where’d you learn this?”
Nancy gestured vaguely at her head.
Binyelum nodded.
“The daydreaming.”
They nodded again.
“You almost ended up in the Things We Carry, didn't you?”
Nancy shrugged.
Binyelum cocked their head.
“Why didn't you?”
Nancy stared.
Then shrugged again.
Velocity sighed.
“I think I might know where to get one.”
Everyone else blinked.
Velocity held up their camera with one hand.
With the other they produced an irregular orb, the texture of it like wet glass, a neon pink light glowing from within. The symbol of a heart pulsed rhythmically in the center. Ephemeral exclamation points drifted fading out from the heart.
Oh shit.
A candy.
What else?
Velocity shrugged.
“I know a guy.”
Everyone else blinked again.
Binyelum whistled.
“Finally got your hands on one.”
They paused.
“From who?”
Velocity gestured toward the party.
“Some guy selling shit.”
Oren said, “Shit, specifically?”
Binyelum said, “And you think he has a flare gun?”
Velocity shrugged.
“Candies were free, he was trying to show off. Seems like a solid bet.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Candies were free, wow. Maybe he’s actually got good stock.”
They paused.
“Flaregun won't be free.”
Velocity’s eyes flashed.
“You never know. I found persuasion to be quite easy.”
Wow.
Oren and Sebastian's eyebrows shot up.
Nancy nodded.
Binyelum said, “And if he isn’t charmed a second time?”
Velocity made a face.
“You don't trust me?”
Binyelum said, “I don't trust some random guy selling a bunch of random shit from some random ass cache in the netherlume shift, especially if it’s more valuable than candies.”
Velocity shrugged.
“We don’t really have anything to exchange.”
Oh.
Sebastian said, “You’ve got that pendant.”
Wait!
Velocity shouted, “Fuck y–”
Jhansi interrupted.
“I have something.”
Fuck!
Now they’d make her explain it!
Everyone else blinked.
Binyelum grinned wide.
Sebastian rolled his eyes.
“More memory card dust?”
Ugh.
Jhansi made a face.
She produced Cephalopatra’s memory card with a flourish.
Smears of mostly dried orange blood covered the surface.
Some of it stained Jhansi’s fingers.
A crust of white stuff clung to one of the shorter edges.
Everyone else blinked again.
Nancy gave Jhansi a look.
Sebastian scowled.
“Where the fuck did you get that?”
Velocity rolled their eyes.
“Still looking to pin a scandal on our princess?”
Oren shook his head.
“Yeah, I don't think she killed anyone.”
Jhansi cringed.
“What the fuck?”
Binyelum shook their head.
“Don't worry.”
They shrugged.
Then leered.
“Unless you did kill someone.”
Jeez!
Jhansi groaned.
“For fuck’s sake, you guys.”
She gestured down the beach.
“No, I watched–”
Wait.
Fuck.
She really had witnessed something pretty fucked up.
She didn’t …
… need to share all the details.
The dark shape smiled.
Jhansi exhaled.
She shook her head.
“–an alterling kill another alterling.”
She paused.
“Probably that bug thing we saw crawling around near the grain elevator.”
Nobody spoke.
Everyone else stared.
Fuck.
Heat rose in Jhansi’s cheeks.
Static crackled.
Binyelum furrowed their brows.
“Where?”
Ugh.
Jhansi pointed where she had gestured.
“Down the beach.”
Binyelum frowned.
“Pretty far down the beach.”
They paused.
“What were you doing out there?”
A bolt of static carved through Jhansi’s shoulders.
She clenched her jaw.
“Nothing bad.”
Binyelum blinked.
“Bad?”
They shook their head.
“I didn’t think so. I just want to know why you wandered so far away.”
Fuck!
More splintering static.
Jhansi ground her teeth and rolled her eyes.
“Well then what the fuck was I supposed to do?”
Oren raised both eyebrows.
“Stay with us?”
A wide arm of static swung hard into Jhansi’s stomach.
Jhansi’s chest heaved.
“Yeah? You think I want to stand on the fucking sidelines and watch the rest of you have fun?”
Everyone else blinked.
Goddammit!
A piercing shower of static.
Oren said, “Why would you do that?”
Oh come on!
Jhansi groaned.
“Like I said, what the fuck else am I supposed to do?”
Oren stepped forward.
Jhansi backed away.
Oren gestured with both hands.
“Have fun.”
He sighed.
He shrugged slowly.
The corners of his mouth fell.
The corners of his eyes, too.
“You literally just taught me that.”
The abusive static hung inert.
Jhansi looked away from Oren.
What?
Her?
A simpering little punching bag?
As fucking if.
She huffed.
“It's not that easy, Oren.”
Oren gave her a wan smile.
“I know.”
He paused.
Then gestured.
“It's also not that hard.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Oren.”
Even after she had told him.
Did he really not understand.
And after she had helped him?
“After I–”
Well.
Figures.
Nobody ever actually understood.
It went with the territory.
The trials of a protagonist.
Jhansi raised both hands.
“–just–”
She clenched her fists.
“–forget it.”
Oren opened his mouth.
Then closed it.
Binyelum stood watching with a reserved expression of almost perfect neutrality.
They cupped their chin.
They gave Jhansi a long look.
Jhansi stared back, and looked away once anxiety overwhelmed her.
Binyelum smiled softly.
They looked out toward the water, then back at the Asterlings.
“Probably still gonna be a hard sell, but it’s the best we’ve got for now.”
Velocity cracked their knuckles.
“We can also just beat him up for it.”
Sebastian snorted.
“Velocity’s true colors at last.”
Velocity shoved Sebastian.
“You thought I was hiding this?”
Binyelum clapped their hands.
“Alright. We’ve got our plan.”
Nancy held up her hand, then knelt again.
Everyone watched her carve additional detail into the drawing.
She smoothed over the hard corners, added shading for depth, and speckled about new topography.
She stood and gestured.
Everyone stared at her.
She grinned.
Sebastian blinked.
“You drew a dick.”
Velocity said, “Peenits.”
Binyelum shouted laughter across the beach.
Oren joined in.
Sebastian chuckled, blinked again, and shook his head.
Jhansi stared at the drawing.
What a stupid thing to do.
A dark giggle pushed its way up through her chest.
It felt really good.
