Jhansi Aur - Encounter VI
[???? MINUTES REMAINING]
Lunar Terminator @ ?.??% Luminosity

Velocity led the Asterings back into the semicircle of cars, past the crowd, toward a back corner. A lime green 2003 Subaru Baja sat atop the thin grass growing at the edge of the beach, lights off, tailgate hanging open, the bed affixed with an extender. Several stacked plywood crates rested in the bed, glowing faintly from within. A decal of a trendy anime protagonist stared at Jhansi from one of the rear windows.
A red-headed special one lounged on the hood of the Subaru. They wore an oversized black t-shirt patterned with a psychedelic rendition of the characters from a popular adult cartoon, a pair of dark tie-dyed board shorts, no shoes, and a pair of aviators. A melange of anime-inspired tattoos spilled down their arms.
They grinned as Velocity approached.
“Loki!”
Velocity smiled back.
“And here I figured the pet name was temporary.”
Mister Merchant sat up.
“What’s with the entourage?”
Velocity clicked their tongue.
“You remembered my pet name, but not my lore. I’ve gotta dock some points.”
MM spread his arms.
“Lore is the past, babe. The past is dead.”
Velocity chuckled darkly.
“I fuckin’ wish.”
MM shrugged.
“If you can dream it, you can make it come true.”
Velocity nodded.
“Great. Perfect. Exactly what I wanted to hear.”
They gestured toward the bed of the Subaru.
“I dream of a flare gun. Think I can make that dream come true, Sandy?”
Moonlight glinted off the silver tooth in Sandy’s grin.
“I know you can, Loki.”
They climbed up onto the roof of the Subaru and began rummaging through the plywood crates.
Binyelum appraised the scene.
Sebastian whispered, “Is this guy for real?”
Velocity said, “I was waiting for you to say that.”
Bineylum called out, “Hey Sandy, where’d you get all that stuff?”
Sandy raised a hand over his shoulder, index finger extended.
“The first rule of merchandise, my fine fall out friend, is to never reveal your sources.”
Binyelum snorted.
“Does it have anything to do with that knocked over mobling caravan?”
Sandy froze for half a second.
“One of the doctor’s rumors?”
Binyelum smirked.
“Actually, we saw it happen.”
Sandy looked up.
“The fuck you did.”
Binyelum’s smirk widened.
“You’re so certain. Because you were there?”
Sandy blanched.
He paused, then threw both hands into the air.
“Fine, whatever. Yeah, this stuff’s from the caravan.”
Binyelum nodded.
“You saw it happen, didn’t you?”
Sandy exhaled.
“Yeah, I saw it.”
Binyelum cocked their head.
“What did it?”
Sandy’s eyebrows appeared above his aviators.
“Colorless.”
Binyelum whistled.
“What’s a colorless want with a mobling caravan?”
Binyelum’s eyes narrowed.
“Wait–”
Sandy nodded.
“Yeah.”
Binyelum made a face.
“Wow.”
They shook their head.
“How in the hell does that happen?”
Sandy shrugged.
“If you can dream it, man.”
Binyelum laughed.
“I guess so.”
Jhansi looked from Binyelum to Sandy, then at each of the Asterlings, all of whom wore expressions of dawning comprehension.
Something else she didn’t understand.
Fucking perfect.
Sandy adjusted the top crate, reached into the one below it, and pulled out a bright orange flare gun.
“The Sandman delivers.”
Binyelum shook their head.
“That’s a terrible nickname.”
Sandy scowled.
“That’s how you want to bargain?”
Binyelum raised both hands.
“I just think you deserve something that fits the vibe. The Sandsation.”
Oren said, “Sand By Me.”
Velocity said, “Sandynamite.”
Sebastian said, “Sandeeznuts.”
Nancy shoved Sebastian playfully.
Jhansi said, “The Sand of Fate.”
Sandy stared at the Asterlings.
“You guys are idiots.”
The Asterlings burst into laughter.
Sandy shook his head.
He twirled the flare gun around his index finger, then paused.
He held the gun delicately in both hands, examining it.
“What do you guys want with this thing, anyway?”
He looked around his hands.
“You wanna let every boogeyman in the city know where you are?”
He fidgeted, pulling the gun against his chest.
“You’re not firing this here.”
He’d said it as a statement.
Binyelum shook their head.
“No, we’re not firing here.”
They gestured around.
“We wouldn’t be able to get nearly enough attention.”
Sandy frowned, then shrugged.
“Whatever. It’s your dust.”
Binyelum smiled.
“Then we’ll take it off your hands.”
Sandy waved the gun.
“Don’t get cocky. I’m not gonna let you kill yourself for free.”
Binyelum scratched their head.
“Planning to use that thing yourself?”
Sandy raised two fingers.
“The second rule of merchandise–”
Binyelum waved their hand.
“Yeah yeah.”
Sandy scowled.
Binyelum continued.
“You won't regret trading it for a memory card.”
Sandy blinked, then laughed.
“A memory card?”
He reached back at patted the bottom crate.
“What do you think I’ve got in here? I wouldn't even know what to do with all these memory cards.”
He looked out over the Asterlings.
“Maybe I could trade ‘em for a Final Hand weapon.”
Binyelum smiled.
“If you wanted one of those, you should’ve joined the Final Hand.”
Sandy shuddered.
“You are just determined to insult me.”
He sighed.
“Ah well. Maybe I already have everything I want. The wealth of a winner, the safety of the social elite.”
He gestured out at the party.
“Access to all my desires for the rest of the night.”
He pulled the gun close to his chest.
“I guess you guys should’ve rolled better.”
He paused, then grinned.
“Tell you what. Bring me something fun to play with, and I’ll teach you how to play the game.”
What?
No.
Absolutely the fuck not.
Jhansi stepped forward.
“Fuck you.”
Sandy smirked.
He opened his mouth.
Jhansi talked over him.
“How many memory cards have you pulled free with your bare hands?”
Sandy’s mouth fell into a hard line.
“Listen–”
Jhansi kept going.
“How many times have you shared your gift?”
Sandy’s mouth pulled into a snarl.
Jhansi kept going.
“Buy a Final Hand weapon?”
She laughed and shook her head.
“What a sad joke. Could you even carry one of those things?”
Sandy barked, “Shut the fuck up.”
Jhansi kept going.
“You don't have what it takes. You're nothing like them.”
Sandy jumped down from the Subaru.
“What, a bootlicking peon?”
Jhansi laughed again.
“At least they believe in something. You think you're a winner? You're just a bottom-feeding nobody. You lucked into one single iota of power tonight, and what are you doing with it?”
She glared.
“Trading it away for sexual favors from stoned party kids.”
Sandy pointed the flare gun at Jhansi.
“What the fuck do you know, huh?”
He gestured with the gun.
“Who do you think you are? You think you're out there playing the hero? You fucking dumbass. Nobody gives a shit. You're gonna die at the end of the night, same as the rest of us.”
He gestured toward the Asterlings.
“Same as your dumbass friends.”
He gestured toward the party.
“Same as those idiot kids.”
He gestured at the air.
“Same as the fucking Final Hand bozos.”
He gestured at himself.
“Same as me.”
He pointed the gun again at Jhansi.
“Only difference is, I’m actually making the best of what I’ve got. It's everyone for himself out here. Sorry not sorry, life ain't fair.”
Jhansi snorted.
She produced the bloodstained memory card.
“You see this?”
Sandy didn't reply.
Jhansi chuckled.
“You really think I’m afraid of you?”
A voice called from behind Jhansi.
“I wanna hear more about these Final Hand bozos.”
Everyone turned.
Two Final Hand soldiers stood silhouetted by the lights of the party, dark weapons restless against their shoulders.
Sandy cursed.
“Pejudo lo anmo.”
He lowered the gun and let his head fall back.
The soldier with broader shoulders took a step forward.
“You know how this ends, right?”
An expression passed briefly across Sandy's face.
The other soldier walked up to the bed of the Subaru.
“Thanks for bringing in all this loot for us. You're a real pal. The Final Hand won't forget this.”
The first soldier walked up to Sandy.
“Whacha got there?”
They grabbed the gun from Sandy and held it dangling by the grip.
“Nice.”
They dragged out the vowel sound.
“Brandishing an interference weapon and talking shit about the Final Hand at a party where they're on active patrol duty.”
They smacked Sandy's shoulder.
“You’ve got a lotta confidence, buddy.”
The other soldier stepped over.
“Doesn't look like there's any others in his band. Just him and the Baja.”
The first soldier leaned in toward Sandy, his voice dripping with mock concern.
“Oh no, you got separated from your friends?”
The other soldier nodded.
“Has to be. A guy like this would never leave a pal behind to die.”
Sandy shrugged off the first soldier’s hand.
“I get it, I get.”
He inhaled, then cursed.
“Fuck!”
He kicked the wheel of the Subaru.
The first soldier went to put their hand on Sandy's shoulder again. Sandy knocked it away. He turned to look at the Asterlings, baring his teeth at Binyelum and Jhansi. He opened his mouth, then closed it. He yanked open the door to his Subaru.
The second soldier grabbed the back of Sandy’s neck.
“Whoa there, you don't want to leave with all our gifts, do you?”
Sandy groaned.
The first soldier turned to Binyelum and nodded at the crates.
“Give me a hand with these.”
Binyelum jabbed their elbow at the other Asterlings.
“He picked me!”
The soldier said, “Ha ha.”
Binyelum and the soldier unpacked the bed of the Subaru.
Sandy stood in the grip of the other soldier, watching limply.
Oren turned to Jhansi.
“Well done.”
Jhansi blinked.
“Huh?”
Oren smirked and shook his head.
“No, of course you didn't do it on purpose. Still.”
He shrugged.
“Nice job.”
Warmth flooded Jhansi's chest.
A door slammed behind her. The sound of engine bells followed. Headlight luminescence washed over the scene, throwing long shadows. The Subaru's wheels spun hard, throwing sand.
The car backed away haphazardly, beyond the semicircle of cars, and lurched along the beach toward the city.
Everyone stood in silence until the tail lights passed out of sight.
The broader soldier said, “What a miserable little shit.”
The other said, “He’s not gonna last another hour.”
Binyelum nodded at the first soldier.
“How do you feel about parting with that?”
The soldier held up the flare gun.
“This?”
Binyelum nodded.
The soldier again examined the gun.
“An interference weapon is a big deal.”
They looked at Jhansi.
She blinked.
Should she say something?
The soldier looked back at Binyelum.
“I can't just give it to you.”
Binyelum nodded.
“Your friends up by the docks, they're dismantling a bigass alterling.”
The soldier nodded.
“I know. What about it?”
Binyelum tilted their head.
“I know something about how it works.”
The soldier straightened.
“And you think we can't figure it out?”
Binyelum raised both hands.
“Not at all. But knowing quicker might help your friends have an easier time tonight.”
The soldier stood for a moment.
They looked again at Jhansi.
They kept looking at her as they replied to Binyelum.
“Ah what the hell. I'm feeling generous.”
They gestured at Binyelum.
“Follow me back up to the captain.”
They turned to the other soldier.
The other soldier said, “Yeah, I’ll take care of the crates.”
The broader soldier nodded.
They motioned. The Asterlings followed them back through the party. They held a brief conversation with another pair of soldiers, then ducked into the 1996 Infiniti G20.
The Asterlings piled into Mambele.
